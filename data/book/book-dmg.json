						"A foreword is normally the place where the author of a book expresses thanks and gratitude. I'm not going to do that here. It's not that everyone involved doesn't deserve congratulations and praise, it's just that I already said all those things in the foreword to the AD&D {@i Player's Handbook}. Everything I said there is true for this book, too. On to other things.",
						"Let's assume that since you're reading this, your are, or plan to be, a Dungeon Master. By now, you should be familiar with the rules in the {@i Player's Handbook}. You've probably already noticed things you like or things you would have done differently. If you have, congratulations. You've got the spirit every Dungeon Master needs. As you go through this rule book, I encourage you to continue to make these choices.",
						"Choice is what the AD&D game is all about. We've tried to offer you what we think are the best choices for your AD&D campaign, but each of us has different likes and dislikes. The game that I enjoy may be quite different from your own campaign. But it is not for me to say what is right or wrong for your game. True, I and everyone working on the AD&D game have had to make fundamental decisions, but we've tried to avoid being dogmatic and inflexible. The AD&D game is yours, it's mine, it's every player's game.",
						"So is there an \"official\" AD&D game? Yes, but only when there needs to be. Although I don't have a crystal ball, it's likely that tournaments and other official events will use all of the core rules in these books. Optional rules may or may not be used, but it's fair to say that all players need to know about them even if they don't have the memorized.",
						"The {@i Player's Handbook} and the {@i Dungeon Master Guide} give you what you're expected to know, but that doesn't mean the game begins and ends there. Your game will go in directions not yet explored and your players will try things others think strange. Sometimes these strange things will work; sometimes they won't. Just accept this, be ready for it, and enjoy it.",
						"Take the time to have fun with the AD&D rules. Add, create, expand, and extrapolate. Don't just let the game sit there, and don't become a rules lawyer worrying about each piddly little detail. If you can't figure out the answer, MAKE IT UP! And whatever you do, don't fall into the trap of believing these rules are complete. They are not. You cannot sit back and let the rule book do everything for you. Take the time and effort to become not just a good DM, but a brilliant one.",
						"At conventions, in letters, and over the phone I'm often asked for the instant answer to a fine point of the game rules. More often than not, I come back with a question\u2014what do {@i you} feel is right? And the people asking the questions discover that not only can they create an answer, but that their answer is as good as anyone else's. The rules are only guidelines.",
						"At the beginning of the first {@i Dungeon Master Guide}, Gary Gygax stressed that each of us, working from a common base, would make the AD&D game grow in a variety of different directions. That is more true today than ever. Don't be afraid of experimentation, but do be careful. As a Dungeon Master, you have great power, and \"with great power comes great responsibility.\" Use it wisely."

				"You are one of a very special group of people: AD&D® game Dungeon Masters. Your job is not an easy one. It requires wit, imagination, and the ability to think and act extemporaneously. A really good Dungeon Master is essential to a good game.",
				"The {@i Dungeon Master Guide} is reserved for Dungeon Masters. Discourage players from reading this book, and certainly don't let players consult it during the game. As long as the players don't know exactly what's in the {@i Dungeon Master Guide}, they'll always wonder what you know that they don't. It doesn't matter whether you have secret information; even if you don't, as long as the players think you do, their sense of mystery and uncertainty is maintained.",
				"Also, this book contains essential rules that are not discussed in the {@i Player's Handbook}. Some of these rules the players will learn quickly during play\u2014special combat situations, the costs of hiring NPCs, etc. Others, however, cover more esoteric or mysterious situations, such as the nature of artifacts and other magical items. This information is in the {@i Dungeon Master Guide} so the DM can control the players' (and hence the characters') access to certain bits of knowledge. In a fantasy world, as in this world, information is power. What the characters don't know {@i can} hurt them (or lead them on a merry chase to nowhere). While the players aren't your enemies, they aren't your allies, either, and you aren't obligated to give anything away for nothing. If characters go hunting wererats without doing any research beforehand, feel free to throw lots of curves their way. Reward those characters who take the time to do some checking.",
				"Besides rules, you'll find a large portion of this book devoted to discussions of the principles behind the rules. Along with this are examinations of the pros and cons of changing the rules to fit your campaign. The purpose of this book, after all, is to better prepare you for your role as game moderator and referee. The better you understand the game, the better equipped you'll be to handle unforeseen developments and unusual circumstances.",
				"One of the principles guiding this project from the very beginning, and which is expressed throughout this book, is this: The DM has the primary responsibility for the success of his campaign, and he must take an active hand in guiding it. That is an important concept. If you are skimming through this introduction, slow down and read it again. It is crucial you understand what you are getting into.",
				"The DM's \"active hand\" extends even to the rules. Many decisions about your campaign can be made by only one person: you. Tailor your campaign to fit your own style and the style of your players.",
				"You will find a lot of information in this book, but you won't find pat answers to all your questions and easy solutions for all your game problems. What you will find instead is a discussion of various problems and numerous triggers intended to guide you through a thoughtful analysis of situations that pertain to your campaign.",
				"The rules to the AD&D 2nd Edition game are balanced and easy to use. No role-playing game we know of has been playtested more heavily than this one. But that doesn't mean it's perfect. What we consider to be right may be unbalanced or anachronistic in your campaign. The only thing that can make the AD&D game \"right\" for all players is the intelligent application of DM discretion.",
				"A perfect example of this is the limit placed on experience levels for demihumans. A lot of people complained that these limits were too low. We agreed, and we raised the limits. The new limits were tested, examined, and adjusted until we decided they were right. But you may be one of the few people who prefer the older, lower limits. Or you may think there should be no limits. In the chapter on character classes, you'll find a discussion of this topic that considers the pros and cons of level limits. We don't ask you to blindly accept every limit we've established. But we do ask that before you make any changes you read this chapter and carefully consider what you are about to do. If, after weighing the evidence, you decide that a change is justified in your game, by all means make the change.",
				"In short, follow the rules as they are written if doing so improves your game. But by the same token, break the rules only if doing so improves your game.",

To make your job easier, the {@i Player's Handbook} and {@i DUNGEON MASTER Guide} have parallel organization. Chapters appear in the same order in both books. That means if you know where to find something in the {@i Player's Handbook}, you also know where to find it in this book.",

						"Being a good Dungeon Master involves a lot more than knowing the rules. It calls for quick wit, theatrical flair, and a good sense of dramatic timing\u2014among other things. Most of us can claim these attributes to some degree, but there's always room for improvement.",
						"Fortunately, skills like these can be learned and improved with practice. There are hundreds of tricks, shortcuts, and simple principles that can make you a better, more dramatic, and more creative game master.",
						"But you won't find them in the {@i DUNGEON MASTER Guide}. This is a reference book for running the AD&D game. We tried to minimize material that doesn't pertain to the immediate conduct of the game. If you are interested in reading more about this aspect of refereeing, we refer you to Dragon® Magazine, published monthly by TSR, Inc. Dragon Magazine is devoted to role-playing in general and the AD&D game in particular. For more than 16 years, Dragon Magazine has published articles on every facet of role-playing. It is invaluable for DMs and players.",
						"If you have never played a role-playing game before but are eager to learn, our advice from the {@i Player's Handbook} is still the best: Find a group of people who already play the game and join them for a few sessions. If that is impractical, the best alternative is to get a copy of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Basic Game. The DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is a less detailed role-playing game. The These will show you what goes on during the game and give you step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run a game with your friends."

				"Each player is responsible for creating his character. As the DM, however, your decisions have a huge impact on the process. You have final approval over any player character that is created. This chapter outlines what you should consider about character creation and gives guidelines on how to deal with some of the common problems that arise during character creation.",
				"Players in most AD&D games use the same character over many game sessions. Most players develop strong ties to their characters and get a thrill from watching them advance, grow, and become more successful and powerful. Your game's success depends on how much your players care about their characters. For these reasons, it is important to let they players create the type of characters they really want to play",

						"At the same time, watch out for a tendency in some players to want the most powerful character possible. Powerful characters are fine if that's the sort of campaign you want. A problem arises, however, if players are allowed to exploit the rules, or your good nature, to create a character who is much more powerful than everyone else's characters. At best, this leads to an unbalanced game. At worst, it leads to bored players and hurt feelings.",
						"Therefore, before any player in your game creates his first character, decide which dice-rolling method to allow: Will you use method I, any of the five alternate methods, or a seventh method of your own devising? Be prepared with an answer right away, because this is one of the first questions your players will ask."

Try to avoid making the announcement just as a player starts rolling up a new character, lest the other players accuse you of favoritism. You know you aren't playing favorites, but it doesn't hurt to avoid the appearance.",

						"The races listed in the {@i Player's Handbook} are only a few of the possible intelligent races populating the worlds of the AD&D game. Adventurous DMs and players may want to experiment with characters of other races, such as orcs, lycanthropes, ogres, lizardmen, or even dragons.",
						"Before you do this, however, you need to know very clearly what you are getting into. Unrestricted or ill-considered use of non-standard races can easily and quickly destroy a campaign. Always consider a new race from a variety of angles:",
						"How does the new race fit with the other player characters? How does it fit in the campaign in general? What could you accomplish with this race that you couldn't with another?",
						"The majority of players who want to play an unusual race desire only the thrill and excitement of a truly challenging role-playing situation. There are, however, a few players who see such races as a way to take advantage of game systems and campaign situations. As with changing level limits and classes allowed, you are well advised to move slowly and carefully in this area.",
						"Allowing player characters of unusual races introduces a whole new set of problems. In creating a new non-human or demihuman player character race, the rules and guidelines below should be followed to preserve game balance.",
						"{@b The race should be humanoid} (i.e., it must have two hands, at least two legs, and stand generally upright). The race must be able to move about on land. It must also be intelligent. An orc or a centaur would be acceptable.",
						"{@b The race cannot possess special abilities} beyond the scope of those already given for the other player character races. Although a dragon can polymorph into human form, it makes an unlikely player character because it has a breath weapon, can change shape, can cast spells, and is not humanoid in its natural state. A brownie probably would not be a player character because it, too, has abilities beyond those of the standard player character races.",
						"{@b The race cannot be extra-dimensional} or draw on extra-dimensional powers. It cannot have innate spellcasting ability, be undead, or possess magic resistance.",
						"{@b The race must be cooperative} and willing to interact with the human world. The duergar, a race of deep-dwelling dwarves, have no desire to deal with humans and avoid contact whenever possible. Satyrs resent intruders into their woods and glades, which rules them out as player characters. You must judge this criterion based on the conditions in your game world.",
						"If these conditions are met, the race can be considered as a possible player character race. Some examples of races that definitely fit the profile are half-orcs, orcs, half-ogres, lizardmen, goblins, centaurs, and kobolds.",
						"When experimenting with a new player character race, allow only one at the start. Do not begin your experiment with a whole party of half-ogres! Start slowly, involving only one player. If the new race is too powerful, it can be easily eliminated.",
						"Once the new race is selected, the real work begins. Examine the race and apply all of the following guidelines to it.",
						"{@b Character Abilities:} All races, regardless of type, use the same ability generation method as all other player characters. Their scores will range from 3 to 18 unless modified by pluses or minuses.",
						"Creature sizes, defined in the {@i Monstrous Compendium}, affect abilities as follows:",
						"Creatures of tiny (T) size have a -3 modifier to Strength. Creatures of small (S) size have a -1 modifier to Strength. Creatures of large (L) size have a +1 modifier to Strength. Huge (H) creatures gain a +2 to Strength and Gigantic (G) creatures have a +4.",
						"Those with an Intelligence less than average (as determined by the DM or as listed in the {@i Monstrous Compendium}) suffer a -1 penalty to Intelligence and those exceptionally Intelligent or greater gain a +1 bonus.",
						"All other ability modifiers are assigned by the DM. Likely candidates include minuses to Charisma and Wisdom and plus or minus adjustments to Dexterity. In all cases, bonuses and penalties should balance out. If a creature has a +1 bonus to Strength, it should have a -1 penalty to another ability. With the exception of Strength, no creature can have a modifier greater than +2 or -2 to any score.",
						"{@b Racial Ability Requirements:} It is possible for a creature to have seemingly illogical ability scores. However, you can set minimums and maximums on these. Table 7 in the {@i Player's Handbook} shows these limits for the standard player character races. It is the DM's job to do the same for nonstandard races.",
						"As a guide, creatures of large size should have at least an 11 Strength and, unless they are described as agile or quick, should have a ceiling of 17 to Dexterity. Dull-witted creatures (those of low Intelligence) should have a limit of 16 to Intelligence.",
						"The DM can waive any requirements if, for example, a player wants (or gets) a hill giant character with Strength 6. Some rationale should be offered, however. (In the case of the weakling hill giant, perhaps he was the runt of the family, cast out by his fellows, and forced to take up adventuring.)",
						"{@b Character Classes:} The DM must judge what character classes the new race can be. Use the information in the next chapter as your guide, and start with a narrow range of options. You can always widen it later.",
						"Almost any sort of creature can be a fighter. None (except humans) can be paladins. Those favoring the outdoors (centaurs, for example) can be rangers.",
						"Those with penalties to Wisdom cannot be priests; others can be priests only if their game description mentions NPC priests and the creature has some type of social organization (a tribe, clan, etc.). No nonstandard creature can be a druid, as this is a human belief system.",
						"Those with penalties to Intelligence cannot be wizards. If the description in the {@i Monstrous Compendium} implies that a creature is stupid, dull-witted, or in any way averse to magic and spell casting, it cannot be a priest or wizard.",
						"A Dexterity penalty prevents the character from being a thief. Creatures of large size or greater cannot be thieves. If it is implied that a creature is clumsy or awkward, it cannot be a thief.",
						"A new character race can be multi-classed if there is more than one potential class open to it (e.g., fighter and mage). Classes from the same group cannot combine into multi-classes (e.g., fighter/ranger). Characters from variant races must also have scores of 14 or higher in the prime requisites of both classes to qualify for multi-class standing. This particular condition does not apply to normal player character races.",
						"{@b Level Limits:} Like all non-humans, new player character races have level limits. However, these limits are lower than those for other non-humans, since these races are often unsuited to adventuring. (Perhaps this explains why player characters of these races are so rare.)",
						"The maximum level a character from a variant race can attain depends on the character's prime requisite ability score (or scores). Use Table 9 to determine the character's maximum level.",

						"Unlike the standard demihuman races, new character races never gain additional levels for high ability scores. It is unusual enough that a member of the race has become a player character at all! Without the aid of many wish spells, a character from a non-standard race can never rise above 12th level.",
						"{@b Alignment:} The {@i Monstrous Compendium} lists alignments for most races. If an absolute alignment is listed (e.g., \"good\"), the player character has that alignment. If only alignment tendencies are given, the player can choose any alignment.",
						"{@b Hit Points:} All creatures roll their hit points using the die appropriate to their chosen class. At 1st level, Large and greater size creatures gain one additional hit point for every Hit Die the creatures would normally receive (pluses to the die are ignored) in addition to their normal Constitution bonus. Thus, an ogre fighter with a Constitution of 12 would still gain a +4 hit point bonus at first level, since ogres normally have 4 Hit Dice. (Remember that Large size creatures suffer larger-than-man-sized damage from weapons!) Thereafter, all new races earn hit points according to level advancement, Constitution, and character class.",
						"{@b Level Advancement:} The character progresses like all others of the same character class. Being a nonstandard race does not give the player character any special benefits to his character class.",
						"{@b Armor:} Most creatures (orcs, gnolls, goblins) have an Armor Class of 10 (and thus wear armor for protection). Some creatures, however, have natural armor which is retained by the player character. These characters gain the benefit of a +1 bonus to their AC only if the armor worn is worse than or equal to their natural Armor Class (as per horse barding).",
						"If better armor is worn, natural armor is ignored and Armor Class is determined by the armor being worn. Odd-sized and odd-shaped creatures can't wear off-the-shelf armor; it must be made to order and costs extra (and takes longer to make).",
						"{@b Movement:} The creature's movement rate is the same as that listed in the {@i Monstrous Compendium}.",
						"{@b Attacks:} The player character is allowed the number of attacks given his character class and level, not the number listed in the monster description in the {@i Monstrous Compendium}.",
						"{@b Size Problems:} Players who play Large-sized creatures hoping to get an advantage over others should quickly discover many problems they didn't anticipate. Consider the plight of the player who decides to have a hill giant. Right away, he'll have a hard time buying basic equipment. Who makes pants for giants in a human town? Everything must be special ordered at two to four times--or more--its normal cost.",
						"This is a minor inconvenience compared to other difficulties. Buildings and dungeons are built for humans and other Medium-sized creatures, denying the large fellow the opportunity for both a hearty drink and exciting adventure. Even the toughest character will tire of drinking from measly cups and buying five dinners at a time. Will he enjoy spending the night in a leaky stable while his companions enjoy warm feather beds upstairs in the inn?",
						"Days of traveling will quickly show him the joys of walking while everyone else rides (no horse can carry him), especially when his companions gallop spryly away from oncoming danger, leaving him in its path. The costs of replacing broken furniture will quickly become prohibitive. Ropes will have an annoying tendency to break when the big lunk tries to climb them. And the hill giant better have at least 20 friends handy to pull him out of that 30-foot pit!",
						"{@b NPC Reactions:} On the personal side, expect NPCs to have strong negative feelings about unusual player character races, even to the point of bigotry and hatred. These reactions will make life more difficult for the player character, but they are the price the player pays for his unusual choice."

						"Yet, at the same time, you know that the concept of classes and levels doesn't really apply to the real world. The teamster driving the wagon that passes the characters isn't a 1st-, 5th-, or 100th-level teamster. He is a man, whose job it is to drive wagons and haul goods. The chambermaid is not a special class, nor are her abilities defined by levels.",
						"The teamster or chambermaid may be exceptionally skilled and competent, but for them this is not measured in character classes. There is no such thing as a teamster or chambermaid class, any more than there are merchant, sailor, prince, blacksmith, hermit, navigator, tinker, beggar, gypsy, or clerk classes. These are the things people do, not all-encompassing descriptions.",
						"Nor are all the people in your campaign world fighters, mages, thieves, or whatever. The situation would be utterly ridiculous if every NPC had a character class. You would have fighter chambermaids, mage teamsters, thief merchants, and ranger children. The whole thing defies logic and boggles the mind. Most non-player characters are people, just people, and nothing more.",
						"Only a few people actually attain any character level. Not every soldier who fights in a war becomes a fighter. Not every urchin who steals an apple from the marketplace becomes a thief. The characters with classes and levels have them because they are in some way special.",
						"This specialness has nothing to do with ability scores, class abilities, or levels. Such characters are special by definition. The fact that player characters are controlled by players renders them special. Perhaps these special characters are more driven or have some unknown inner spark or just the right combination of talents and desires. That's up to the players. Similarly, non-player characters with classes are special because the DM says so. Plain and simple. There is no secret reason for this\u2014it just is."

						"The great mass of humanity, elf-kind, the dwarven clans, and halflings, are \"0-level\" (zero-level) characters. They can gain in wisdom and skill, but they do not earn experience points for their activities. These common folk form the backbone of every fantasy world, doing the labor, making goods, selling cargos, sailing oceans, building ships, cutting trees, hauling lumber, tending horses, raising crops and more. Many are quite talented in the various arts and crafts. Some are even more proficient than player characters with the same training. After all, 0-level characters earn their livings doing this kind of work. For player characters such proficiencies are almost more of a hobby.",
						"For the vast majority of 0-level NPCs you create and use in your game, all you need to know is a name, a personality, and an occupation. When the characters deal with the blacksmith or the innkeeper, there's no need to create ability scores, THACO, to-hit adjustments, Armor Class, and the like. This does assume, of course, that your player characters don't go attacking every blacksmith and innkeeper in sight. If they do, you need to know a little more about 0-level characters.",
						"{@b Ability Scores:} These range from 3-18. For simplicity, don't worry about racial modifiers for the demihuman races. Racial modifiers to combat, Armor Class, hit points, etc., do apply.",
						"{@b Proficiencies:} At best, a 0-level character will have one weapon proficiency, if that character's profession reasonably allows for it. For example, a blacksmith could be proficient with a warhammer and an innkeeper might be allowed skill with a club (the axe handle under the bar...), but there's little chance a clerk is going to be skilled with any type of weapon.",
						"In nonweapon proficiencies, 0-level characters have as many as are needed (and reasonable) given their profession and age. Thus, a blacksmith might be quite accomplished at the forge, having spent several proficiencies on the slot. Novices and incompetent craftsmen have the bare minimum training and skill. Typical journeymen spend two or three slots on their main skill. Experts and brilliant artists usually devote all their ability to a single proficiency. Masters, who watch over the work of journeymen and apprentices, are normally no more accomplished than journeymen but have additional proficiencies in other business areas.",

They must meet the least stringent class requirements and are drawn from the biggest pool of talent\u2014soldiers of innumerable armies, mercenary companies, militias, palace guards, temple hosts, and sheriff's men. In these and other forces, the potential fighter learns his trade. He is taught how to handle weapons and care for them. He picks up some basic tactics and earns acceptance as a fighting man.",
								"From these ranks some go on to become 1st-level fighters. Such men are often given rank in recognition of their talents. Thus, a 1st-level fighter may become a corporal or a sergeant. As the ranks become greater and more influential, the tendency is to award these to higher level fighters. However, this trend is not absolute and often breaks down at the highest levels. The captain of the company may be a 12th-level fighter, but he would still take orders from a 0-level prince!",
								"Level is no guarantee of rank, nor is rank fixed to level. Some people don't want responsibility and all that comes with it. They would rather let other people tell them what to do. Such characters may become accomplished fighters but never advance beyond the rank of common soldier. Political maneuvering and favoritism can raise even the lowest level character to the highest positions of authority.",
								"Since fighters tend to rise above the level of the common soldier, few armies are composed of high- or even low-level fighters. While there is little difference in ability between the typical foot soldier and a 1st-level fighter, it is just not possible to find an army of 20,000 4th-level fighters. It's rare enough to find 1,000 or so 2nd-level fighters in a single unit. Such units are elite, superbly trained and outfitted, and are normally held in reserve for special tasks. They may be the shock troops of an assault, a special bodyguard, or the reserve of an army held back for pursuit.",
								"Adventurer fighters (whether player characters or NPCs) are those who have struck out on their own. Not every man is content to take orders or give orders, and fame seldom comes to the common foot soldier. Some men are willing to try to rise through the ranks, but it is by no means an easy or speedy process. There aren't many openings, nor is it a path where skill at arms guarantees success.",
								"Given all this, it's not surprising that most fighters opt for the more direct method of adventuring. In the course of adventuring, though, many fighters find themselves becoming leaders and commanders, assembling men around them as they carve their own place in the world."

You will not find units with thousands, hundreds, or even tens of paladins. At best, they form small groups (such as the Twelve Peers of Charlemagne or some of the Knights of the Round Table).",

But, at the same time, they tend to be ill-suited to the task of ruling, which too often requires compromise of one's principles.

Small groups of rangers will sometimes join an army as its scouts, especially if the need is pressing. They will occasionally be found in forest villages or near untracked wildernesses.

But wizards are too fractious and independent a lot to organize themselves into proper unions\u2014they can barely manage to form moderately organized guilds.",
								"enerally, their groups exist for such high-minded reasons as to \"facilitate the exchange of knowledge\" or \"advance the state of the science of magic.\" Some prepare texts or papers to share with fellow mages, detailing their latest experiments and discoveries or outlining some new theory.

The vast majority spend their time experimenting in seclusion or working in the service of others, preferably well paid.",
								"Many mages, especially those of lesser ability, turn their art to practical ends\u2014almost every village has a fellow who can whip up a few useful spells to help with the lambing or simplify the construction of a house. In larger cities, these mages become more specialized, such that one might lend his talents to construction, another to the finding of lost things, and a third to aiding the local jewelers in their craft.",
								"Nearly all major families, merchant princes, and nobles have a mage or two in their employ. A few attempt (generally without success) to have these wizards massproduce magical items. The problem is that wizards are as difficult to manage as rangers or paladins. They do not care for others bossing them around or encroaching upon their perceived privileges and rights, especially since they have the magical resources to make their displeasure known. Also, they are usually kept busy finding ways to strike at their employer's rivals (or thwarting such attempts against their own lord). Foolish is the king who does not have a personal wizard, and lamentable is the ruler who trusts the wrong mage.",
								"Not all wizards spend their time in the service of others. Some seek naught but knowledge. These scholar-mages tend to be viewed much like great university professors today\u2014noble and distant, pursuing truth for its own sake. While not directly in the service of others, they can sometimes be commissioned to perform some duty or answer some question.",

This situation is not unlike that of the great artists of the Renaissance who were supported by princes hoping to impress and outdo their rivals.",
								"There are wizards who spend all their time shut away from humanity in dark, forbidding towers or gloomy, bat-infested caves. Here they may live in rooms where opulent splendor mingles with damp foulness. Perhaps the strains and demands of their art have driven them mad.

Non-adventuring clergy are no less devout than their adventuring brethren, nor do they receive any less respect.

Sometimes this rise is associated with level ability, but more often it is a measure of the don's judge of character and political adeptness.",

Their talents in the field are too valuable to lose, and their effort is expended on their art, not on maneuvering and toadying. There is, in fact, no rule that says the leader of the thieves' guild has to be a thief.

Although some bards settle down in a town or city, most travel from place to place. Even \"tamed\" bards (as the settled ones are sometimes called) feel the urge to go out and explore, gather a few more tales, and come home with a new set of songs. After all, the entertainment business demands variety.",

Campaigns that commonly have 4th- to 8th-level characters consider those with 12th-level or more to be high level, while those with 12th-level characters set the limit closer to 18th or 20th level. While there is no set break-point for high level, character duties and responsibilities begin to change between 9th and 12th level.",
								"Generally, players find battling monsters and discovering treasure to be less and less satisfying as time goes on.

Higher level characters have great power\u2014they should have adventures where that power influences and involves them in the campaign world. As leaders, rulers, and wise men, their actions affect more than just themselves, spreading outward in ripples over those they rule and those they seek to conquer. Political machinations, spying, backroom deals, treachery, and fraud become more pronounced. While these elements can play a part in a low-level campaign, at higher levels, the stakes are much greater.",
								"Added intrigue can be introduced into a campaign gradually. For example, Varrack, a mid-level fighter, is appointed sheriff of a local village as a reward for his sterling deeds. He can still adventure as he has been accustomed to, but now he must also watch over the villagers. The DM has the local bandits raid the trade road. As sheriff, Varrack must stop them. He goes with a small group, only to discover a camp of 500 outlaws. Realizing he's badly outnumbered, he beats a hasty retreat, raises a small militia, and clears the countryside of the enemy.",
								"With this he rises in level. In addition, his lord is pleased and grants Varrack stewardship of several villages, with sheriffs under his command. The neighboring baron (who organized and sent the bandits) notes Varrack's success with mild displeasure, planting the seed of a festering hate. More immediately, the craven and vengeful sheriff of the next village on the road (whose incompetence allowed the bandits to flourish) suddenly finds himself out of favor. He blames Varrack and searches for a way to bring the new steward down.",
								"As the campaign progresses, the DM can slowly spin a web of intrigue around Varrack as enemies, open and hidden, seek to block his progress or use him to topple his own lord. Against the odds, Varrack may find himself destined to become the king's champion, gaining new titles, responsibilities, friends, and enemies along the way."

										"The character classes listed in the rules are not the only ones that can exist in the AD&D game. Many other character classes, either general or highly specialized, could also exist. Indeed, a common reaction of players to the character classes is to question why their characters can't have the powers or skills of another class. You can even create entirely new classes or combinations of existing character abilities.",
										"The class-creation system here requires you to use your judgment\u2014it isn't fool-proof. Without careful thought, you may find you've created an overly forceful combination of powers or a bizarre, unplayable character class. As with new character races, start with a single test case before you approve the class for all players.",
										"Naturally, the DM must approve a class before a player can begin using it. The DM also has the right to make any changes he sees fit, even after the character has been played for some time!",
										"You are advised not to try to create a super class\u2014a class that allows players to do everything. Consider what is lost: A super character would require an immense amount of experience just to reach 2nd level. Normal characters would reach much higher levels, much sooner, and may even surpass the super character in ability. A super character also destroys party cooperation and group play. If you have a character who can do everything, you don't need other characters (and hence other players). Further, a whole group of super characters is nothing more than a group of one-class characters. You lose as much variety, as much color, as if you had a group consisting only of fighters. And a group of fighters (or any other single class), no matter what their abilities, is boring. There is nothing to distinguish Joe Fighter from Fred Fighter in ability",
										"Another factor to consider when creating new character classes is whether a new class is really needed. Some players want to create a character class for every profession or ability\u2014jesters, witches, vampire hunters, vikings, mountaineers, etc. They forget that these are really roles, not classes.",

Some players want to create a character class for every profession or ability\u2014jesters, witches, vampire hunters, vikings, mountaineers, etc. They forget that these are really roles, not classes.",
										"The same is true of assassins. Killing for profit requires no special powers, only a specific, reprehensible outlook. Choosing the title does not imply any special powers or abilities. The character just uses his current skills to fulfill a specific, personal set of goals.",
										"Before creating a character class, stop and ask yourself, \"Is there already a character class that can fill the niche?\" Think of ways an existing class could fulfill the desired goal through role-playing and careful choice of proficiencies. A mountaineer could easily be a fighter or ranger, born and bred on the slopes, with a love of the rugged peaks and proficiencies in climbing, mountaineering, and the like. There is no need for a mountaineer class.",
										"Also, consider how much fun the character is going to be to play. This is particularly true when you plan to create classes with highly specialized abilities. True, there may be a place for wise old sages or alchemists, but would they be fun to play? Consider that all the sage does is conduct research and answer questions. An important task, perhaps, but boring when compared to fighters, mages, and the like. Clearly there is no great demand for the sage as a player character. So, there is no need for the character class.",
										"Finally, remember that there is no such thing as an exclusively NPC character class. What is the logic of saying a nonplayer character can be such-and-such, but a player character cannot? None. This is a false restriction. Every character class you create should be open to player characters and nonplayer characters alike.",
										"With all these considerations in mind, you can use the system described below to create new character classes. You are encouraged to modify the system or create one of your own. The method used here will give you a good starting place.",
										"To use this method, choose different abilities you want the class to have. You must include some aptitudes such as fighting. But other abilities, such as spellcasting, are optional. Each ability you choose has a multiple attached to it. As you select the abilities for your class and add the multiples together. After you have chosen all the abilities, multiply the base experience value (see Table 21) by this total. The result is the number of experience points your new class must earn to go up in levels.",
										"Required Abilities: For each of the categories, choose one of the options listed. Be sure to note this choice along with the multiple cost.",

								"{@b Lawful Good:} the people are generally honest, law-abiding, and helpful. They mean well (at least most of them do). They respect the law. As a rule, people don't walk around wearing armor and carrying weapons. Those who do are viewed with suspicion or as trouble-makers. Some societies tend to dislike adventurers, since they often bring trouble.",
								"{@b Lawful Neutral:} The people are not only law-abiding, they are passionate creators of arcane bureaucracies. The tendency to organize and regulate everything easily gets out of control.",
								"In large empires there are ministries, councils, commissions, departments, offices, and cabinets for everything. If the region attracts a lot of adventurers, there are special ministries, with their own special taxes and licenses, to deal with the problem. The people are not tremendously concerned with the effectiveness of the government, so long as it functions.",
								"{@b Lawful Evil:} The government is marked by its severe laws, involving harsh punishments regardless of guilt or innocence. Laws are not intended to preserve justice so much as to maintain the status quo. Social class is crucial. Bribery and corruption are often ways of life. Adventurers, since they are outsiders who may be foreign agents, are viewed with great suspicion. Lawful evil kingdoms often find themselves quashing rebellions of oppressed peasants clamoring for humane treatment.",
								"{@b Neutral Evil, Neutral Good, and True Neutral:} Areas dominated by these three alignments tend to adopt whatever government seems most expedient at the moment. A particular form of government lasts as long as the ruler or dynasty in power can maintain it. The people cooperate when it suits them\u2014or, in the case of true neutrals, when the balance of forces must be preserved.",
								"Such neutral territories often act as buffer states between lands of extreme alignment difference (for example, between a lawful good barony and a vile chaotic evil principality). They shift allegiance artfully to preserve their borders against the advances of both sides in a conflict.",
								"Neutral evil countries tend to be benign (but not pleasant) dictatorships while neutral good countries are generally \"enlightened\" dictatorships. Transfers of power are usually marked by shifts in government, though these are often bloodless coups. There is a certain apathy about politics and government. Adventurers are treated the same as everyone else.",
								"{@b Chaotic Good:} The people mean well and try to do right, but are hampered by a natural dislike of big government. Although there may be a single ruler, most communities are allowed to manage themselves, so long as their taxes are paid and they obey a few broad edicts. Such areas tend to have weak law enforcement organizations. A local sheriff, baron, or council may hire adventurers to fill the gap. Communities often take the law into their own hands when it seems necessary. Lands on the fringes of vast empires far from the capital tend to have this type of alignment.",
								"{@b Chaotic Neutral:} There is no government. Anarchy is the rule. A stranger to such a town may feel as if he has ridden into a town of madmen.",
								"{@b Chaotic Evil:} The people are ruled by, and live in fear of, those more powerful than themselves. Local government usually amounts to a series of strongarm bosses who obey the central government out of fear. People look for ways to gain power or keep the power they've got. Assassination is an accepted method of advancement, along with coups, conspiracies, and purges. Adventurers are often used as pawns in political power games, only to be eliminated when the adventurers themselves become a threat."

This goal is useful when constructing adventures.

Also, a sense of heroism permeates the game. Players know that their characters are doing something important, something that has an effect on the history of the campaign world.",
								"There are disadvantages to this approach, too, but none that can't be avoided by a clever DM. First is the question of boredom. If every adventure revolves around maintaining balance or crusading for the cause, players might get tired of the whole thing.",
								"The solution is simply to make sure adventures are varied in goal and theme. Sometimes characters strive in the name of the great cause. Other times they adventure for their own benefit. Not every battle needs to be a titanic struggle of good vs. evil or light vs. darkness.",
								"Another concern is that everything the characters do may affect their quest. An aligned game universe is one of massive and intricate cause-and-effect chains. If X happens over here, then Y must happen over there. Most adventures must be woven into the thread of the storyline, even those that don't seem to be a part of it.",
								"This is in direct conflict with the need for variety, and the DM must do some careful juggling. A big quest is easy to work into the story, but what happens when the player characters take some time off to go on their own adventure? Are they needed just then? What happens in their absence? How do they get back on track? What happens when someone discovers something no one was meant to know? For these problems there are no easy answers. A creative DM will never be idle with this sort of campaign.",
								"Finally, there is the problem of success and failure. An aligned universe tends to create an epic adventure. Player characters become involved in earthshaking events and deal with cosmic beings. Being at the center of the game, player characters assume great importance (if they don't, they will quickly get bored). This is standard stuff in sword-and-sorcery fiction, so it is natural that it also appears in a sword-and-sorcery role-playing adventure.",
								"Fiction writers have an advantage DMs do not, however\u2014they can end the story and never return to it. At the end of the book, the good guys win, the world is set right, and the covers are closed. The writer never has to worry about it again, unless he wants to. What happens when characters win the final conflict, the battle that puts all to right? What can be done after peace and harmony come to the universe?",
								"Further, the author knows who is going to win. He starts by knowing the good guys will triumph. There may be many twists, but eventually the heroes come out on top. Many DMs make the same assumption. They are wrong.",
								"Never simply assume that the characters will win. What if they don't? What if the forces of darkness and evil win the final battle? No matter how high the odds are stacked in their favor, there is always a chance that the characters will do something so stupid or unlucky that they lose. Victory cannot be guaranteed.

								"In this case, the DM is justified in instituting an immediate alignment change to lawful evil or even chaotic evil. The character eventually might be able to change back to lawful good alignment, but he will never again be a paladin."

						"Although player characters can change alignment, it is not something that should be approached lightly, since there are serious consequences. When a character changes alignment, he does more than just change his attitudes. He is altering his perception of the world and his relationship to it. Much of what he learned previously was flavored by his alignment. When the philosophical foundations of his life change, the character discovers that he must relearn things he thought he knew.",
						"There are two possible effects of changing alignment, depending on the situation and circumstances of the change. The first results in no penalty. This effect only should be used when the player and the DM mutually agree that the character's alignment should be changed to improve the play of the game.",
						"Most often this occurs with low-level characters. The player character's alignment may prove to be incompatible with the rest of the party. A player character may simply be more interesting for everyone if his alignment were different. Inexperienced players may select an alignment without fully understanding its ramifications. Discovering they simply do not like the alignment, they may ask to change. Such changes must be made with mutual agreement. As DM, try to accommodate the desires of your players.",
						"In the second type of voluntary change, the case cannot be made that the alignment change would be for the good of the game. This generally involves more established characters who have been played according to one alignment for some time. Here, the effects of alignment change are severe and noticeable.",
						"The instant a character voluntarily changes alignment, the experience point cost to gain the next level (or levels in the case of multi-class characters) is doubled. To determine the number of experience points needed to gain the next level (and only the next level), double the number of experience points listed on the appropriate Experience Levels table.",
						"For example, Delsenora the mage began the game neutral good. However, as she adventured, she regularly supported the downtrodden and the oppressed, fighting for their rights and their place in society. About the time she reached 5th level, it was clear to the DM that Delsenora was behaving more as a lawful good character and he enforced an alignment change. Normally, a mage needs 40,000 experience points\u201420,000 points beyond 5th level\u2014to reach 6th level. Delsenora must earn 40,000 additional experience points, instead of the normal 20,000. Every two experience points counts as one toward advancement.",
						"Delsenora started the adventure with 20,000 experience points. At its conclusion, the DM awarded her 5,300 points, bringing her total to 25,300. Instead of needing just 14,700 points to reach the next level, she now needs 34,700 because of her alignment change!",
						"If an alignment change is involuntary, the doubled experience penalty is not enforced. Instead, the character earns no experience whatever until his former alignment is regained. This assumes, of course, that the character wants to regain his former alignment.",
						"If the character decides that the new alignment isn't so bad after all, he begins earning experience again, but the doubling penalty goes into effect. The player does not have to announce this decision. If the DM feels the character has resigned himself to the situation, that is sufficient.",
						"For example, Beornhelm the Ranger carelessly dons a helmet that switches him to chaotic evil alignment\u2014something he didn't want to do! Exerting its influence over him, the helm compels Beornhelm to commit all manner of destructive acts. Although unable to resist physically, Beornhelm keeps looking for an opportunity to escape the accursed helm. Finally, after several misadventures, he cleverly manages to trick an evil mage into removing the helm, at which point he is restored to his previous alignment.",
						"He gains no experience from the time he dons the helm to the time he removes it (though the DM may grant a small award if Beornhelm's plan was particularly ingenious). If Beornhelm had chosen not to trick the mage but to work with him, the change would immediately be considered a player choice. From that point on Beornhelm would earn experience, but he would have to earn twice as much to reach the next experience level.",
						"A character can change alignment any number of times. If more than one change occurs per level, however, the severity of the penalty increases. (The character is obviously suffering from severe mental confusion, akin to a modern-day personality crisis.) When a character makes a second or subsequent alignment change at a given level, all experience points earned toward the next level are immediately lost. The character must still earn double the normal experience.",
						"Delsenora drifted into lawful good. Now she finds lawful good too restrictive. She is confused. She doesn't know what she believes in. Her head hurts. The character reverts to her earlier neutral good habits. Bedeviled by indecision, she loses the 5,300 experience points she had already gained and now has to earn 40,000 to achieve 6th level!"

				"A character in the AD&D game, like anyone else, has a variety of skills and talents. He is good at some things (because they are used in his profession or hobby) and poor at those he has studied casually or not at all. These skills and talents are called proficiencies.",
				"Proficiencies aren't exactly like the skills people pick up in school or in the \"real\" world. They tend to be unrealistically broad or narrow, depending on the subject. The fishing proficiency, for example, assumes the character knows everything about both rod-and-reel fishing and net fishing. In reality, these are two vastly different skills.",
				"At the other end of the spectrum, weapon proficiencies tend to be very precise, highlighting the subtle differences between weapons. A long bow and a short bow differ in size, weight, pull, arrow length, and balance. Each demands different practices to get optimum utility.",
				"When using proficiencies, remember that these rules are not intended to recreate reality. It might have been more realistic to list different proficiencies for each aspect of medieval botany\u2014horticulture, herbalism, mycology, etc. But in the context of a game, these are much better grouped under a single proficiency. Individually, each proficiency would be of such limited usefulness that all of them would become worthless. Other proficiencies, particularly weapons, go to the other extreme.",

					"page": 30,
					"entries": [
						"Sooner or later a player will complain that the weapon proficiencies are too restrictive. But the real complaint may be that the rules don't allow a character to do everything the player wants.",
						"For example, say a player character is proficient with a long sword. He's about to be overwhelmed by a horde of kobolds, but he has the sense to retreat. Unfortunately, he trips over his feet and falls face-first to the floor! His faithful, trusted long sword skitters from his grip and the little monsters are upon him. Still full of fight, the character wrests a short sword from the nearest beastie and begins to do battle.",
						"At this point, the DM tells the player to apply the nonproficiency penalty. The player howls in outrage. \"It's a sword,\" he moans. \"My character can use a long sword, I can't believe you won't let him use a short sword! It's the same thing, just smaller!\" Before giving in to the player's protests, consider the differences in what seem to be similar weapons.",
						"The character's customary weapon, the long sword, is a slashing weapon. It is three- to four-feet long, heavy, and balanced toward the blade to increase momentum in a slash. A short sword is a piercing weapon. It is 12 to 18 inches long, light (for a sword), and balanced with most of the weight toward the handle for quick reaction.",
						"So, in our example, the character leaps into the fight using the short sword instinctively\u2014the way he would use a long sword. He tries to slash, but the weapon is too short and light for slashing. He tries to block and parry and finds the weapon absorbs much less impact than his massive long sword. He tends to attack the air, because he is used to the reach and sweep of the long sword. He throws himself off balance by swinging the light weapon too hard. All these minor errors make him less effective with the short sword, even though it seems similar to his long sword. The nonproficiency penalty begins to make sense.",
						"Further, weapon proficiencies are just some of the many factors that must be balanced for a successful adventure. If a variety of factors combine to give a character excessive combat bonuses, the DM should create situations in which that character's favorite weapon is not the best choice.",
						"For example, a character who is proficient with all types of swords, but no other weapons, is at a big disadvantage when confronted by skeletons. His sword is less effective than a mace. Eventually, the player will have to broaden his character's weapon proficiencies if he wants to thrive in the AD&D game world."

						"Sometimes players resort to \"min/ proficiencies. Min/maxing occurs when a player calculates all the odds and numerical advantages and disadvantages of a particular weapon. The player's decision isn't based on his imagination, the campaign, roleplaying, or character development. It is based on game mechanics\u2014what will give the biggest modifier and cause the most damage in any situation.",
						"A certain amount of min/maxing is unavoidable, and even good (it shows that the player is interested in the game), but an excessive min/maxer is missing the point. Reducing a character to a list of combat modifiers and dice rolls is not role-playing.",
						"Fortunately, this type of player is easy to deal with. Just create a situation in which his carefully chosen weapon, the one intended to give him an edge over everyone else, is either useless or puts him at a disadvantage. He will suddenly discover the drawback of min/maxing. It is impossible to create a combination of factors that is superior in every situation, because situations can vary so much.",
						"Finally, a character's lack of proficiency can be used to create dramatic tension, a vital part of the game. In the encounter with kobolds described earlier, the player howled in surprise because the situation suddenly got a lot more dangerous than he expected it to. The penalty for nonproficiency increases the risk to the player character, and that increases the scene's tension.",
						"When a nonproficiency penalty is used to create tension, be sure the odds aren't stacked against the character too much. Dramatic tension exists only while the player thinks his character has a chance to escape, even if it's only a slim chance. If a player decides the situation is hopeless, he will give up. His reaction will switch from excitement to despair."

They provide a useful gauge when a character tries to build a boat or behave properly at court. This frees the DM to think about more important parts of the story instead of little, perhaps even insignificant, details.",
						"Not everyone agrees with this! Some DMs prefer to handle by themselves all the situations covered by proficiencies. This requires a quick wit and good memory. In return, the DM is freed from the restraints of rules. He can create the scene he wants without worrying whether it breaks the rules. But tread softly here\u2014this is not an easy way to judge a game! Try this only if you are experienced at DMing or are a spontaneous and entertaining storyteller.",
						"{@b Nonweapon proficiencies give a player character more depth.} Used cleverly, they tell the player more about the personality and background of his character and give him more tools to work with. Applied judiciously and thoughtfully, nonweapon proficiencies vastly increase a character's role-playing potential.",
						"Beware, however, because nonweapon proficiencies can have exactly the opposite effect. They can become a crutch for players who are unwilling to role-play, an excuse not to develop a character's personality or history. Some players decide that proficiencies define everything the character knows; they make no effort to develop anything else.",
						"Avoid this by encouraging players to dig deeper and explore the possibilities in their characters. Ask a player to explain why his character has specific proficiencies. What did that character do before becoming an adventurer? Questions like this stimulate players to delve into their characters' personalities and backgrounds. Make a note of the player's reasons and then you can use them during play.",
						"{@b Nonweapon proficiencies can be used to define the campaign and create atmosphere.} The proficiency lists can be tailored to match specific regions or historical periods, or to define the differences between nationalities.",
						"If the characters' home base is a fishing village, the lists can be altered to allow all characters to learn swimming, sailing, fishing, and navigation at the same cost (in proficiency slots). These are common skills among seafaring people.",
						"At the same time, dwarves, who come to this town from the nearby mountains, must devote extra slots to learn these proficiencies. A youth spent in dry, solid tunnels hasn't prepared them for a life at sea. Instead, they can learn mining, gemcutting, and other stonework skills cheaply.",
						"The proficiency lists in the Player's Handbook are only a beginning. Your campaign will develop a much more interesting flavor if separate lists are tailored to different regions.",
						"This still leaves the problem of min/maxing. Players are encouraged to make intelligent and sensible choices for their characters, but not at the expense of role-playing. If tailored lists are in use, encourage players to list the proficiencies they want without getting to see the lists of proficiencies. Then collect the lists and figure out which proficiencies the characters can get (some may be unavailable and others too expensive).",
						"Players will still request the proficiencies they think are most advantageous, but at least the selections are drawn partially from the players' imaginations instead of a list of numbers.",
						"Finally, proficiencies are only as useful as the DM makes them. Once a decision is made to use proficiencies in the campaign, the DM must strive to create situations where they are useful. Always remember to design encounters, traps, and scenes where proficiencies have a practical application to the problem at hand. Otherwise, players are going to write off proficiencies as a waste of time and miss out on a wonderful chance to expand their characters.",
						"Ultimately, proficiencies add much richness, detail, and role-playing to a campaign at only a small cost in increased complexity. The DM has to remember a few more rules and the players have to make a few more choices when creating their characters. But in return, the game is bigger, better, and more fun."

The proficiencies given are the ones that characters will most commonly want or need, and those that have significant, specialized effects worthy of explanation. DMs and players will certainly think of proficiencies they'd like to add.",
						"Wherever the idea for a new proficiency comes from, the DM is the person who decides whether to include it in the game and what its effects are. This is not a decision for the players, although they can offer suggestions and advice. Only after a new proficiency is approved by the DM can it be used in play.",
						"One important factor to remember is that no proficiency should be beyond the science and technology of the age. There's no proficiency on the list that allows a character to build a gasoline engine, and with good reason. A gasoline engine is far beyond the pseudo-medieval society presented in the AD&D game.",
						"At the same time, this is a fantasy game filled with magical effects and strange powers. With magic, it is not impossible to have outlandish and amazing proficiencies if players and DMs want them. They may have a serious effect on the game, however, and must be carefully considered.",
						"The majority of new proficiencies are going to be those related to trades. Most of these have a very minor game effect, if any at all. They give the character specialized knowledge, but it is up to the player to make some use of it.",
						"A character with the skills of a glazier (glass-maker) does not gain a great advantage. Although, if necessary, he could support himself by making small glass vials and other items for local mages and adventurers. Still, there might come a day when knowledge of glass and glassmaking becomes vital to the success of an adventure. A clever player is always looking for a way to turn knowledge to his advantage.",
						"When a player proposes a new proficiency, have him prepare a description of what the proficiency entails and allows. Then consider what the character could gain from it. This is not to say that the player is trying to pull a fast one (some will, but give them the benefit of the doubt). Instead, it is useful to imagine ways the proficiency could be abused. If something horrible or game-busting comes to mind, fix it. Never allow a proficiency into the game if it seems too powerful.",
						"Make whatever changes are necessary in the description and then offer it to the player. If he still likes it (after all the secret powers are stripped out), introduce it into the game and have fun. Sometimes the only thing that can be kept is the name of the proficiency. Don't be distressed by this. Most players will be satisfied with DM changes, content simply to contribute something to the game."

Normally 12 to 20 were equal to a single besant (6\u201310 would equal one gp) but in Aquitaine they were often valued just like other silver pennies.

Naturally, there is no way to ascertain the origin of the mount, unless you decide the horse has been branded or marked in some way.

						"As a general guideline, experience points should be given at the end of every gaming session, while the DM still remembers what everyone did. If the awarding of experience points is delayed for several sessions, until the end of a given adventure, there is a chance the DM will overlook or forget what the characters did in previous gaming sessions.",
						"Despite this risk, it isn't always practical to award experience immediately. If the player characters are still in the heart of the dungeon when the gaming session ends, wait to award points until they return to the surface. The DM can rule that characters receive experience only when they have the opportunity to rest and tell others of their exploits. This means that characters collect experience when they return to their homes, stop at an inn, or the like. Since experience is, in part, increased confidence and comprehension of their own abilities and events, the retelling of the tale boosts the ego of the characters, and this translates into experience.",
						"Sometimes, even this rule is not applicable, however. For example, the player characters might be on a long journey through the desert and not see a settlement or friendly soul for weeks on end. In such cases, experience can be awarded after the characters have had time to reflect upon and analyze their accomplishments. This may be as short as overnight (for small experience awards) or as long as several days.",
						"If, for whatever reason, the DM decides not to award experience points at the end of a gaming session, he should be sure to calculate and record the number of experience points each character should receive for the session and not rely on his memory."

The character gains an additional die of hit points, or a set number of hit points at higher levels. These are added to both his current total and his maximum number of hit points.

To their minds all improvement is associated with schooling, practice, and study. Others argue that characters are constantly doing these things to increase their ability so formal schooling is not required. Either case may be true.",
										"The DM might choose to require characters to train before they increase in level. To train, a character must have a tutor or instructor. This tutor must be of the same class and higher level than the one the character is training for. Thus, a 7th-level fighter training for 8th-level must be taught by a 9th-level or higher fighter. The tutor must also know the appropriate things. Fighters specialized in a given weapon must find a tutor also specialized in that weapon. Mages seeking to study a particular spell must find a tutor who knows that spell. A thief seeking to improve his lockpicking must find a higher-level tutor more accomplished in lockpicking.",
										"Since not all characters are suited to instructing others, any player character who attempts to train another must make both a Wisdom check and a Charisma check. If the Wisdom check is passed, the player character possesses the patience and insight to nurture the student. If the Charisma check is passed, the character also has the wit, firmness, and authority needed to impress the lessons on the student. If either check is failed, that character is close, but just not a teacher. If both checks are failed, the character has absolutely no aptitude for teaching. Alternatively, the DM can dispense with the die rolls and rule for each player character, based on his knowledge of that character's personality. It is assumed that all NPC tutors have successfully passed these checks.",
										"Second, the character must pay the tutor. There is no set amount for this. The tutor will charge what he thinks he can get away with, based on either greed or reputation. The exact cost must be worked out between player character and tutor, but an average of 100 gp per level per week is not uncommon.",
										"Finally, the player character must spend time in training. The amount of time required depends on the instructor's Wisdom. Subtract the Wisdom score from 19. This is the minimum number of weeks the player character must spend in training\u2014it takes his instructor this long to go through all the lessons and drills. At the end of this time, the player character makes an Intelligence or Wisdom check, whichever is higher.",
										"If the check is successful, the lessons have been learned and the character can advance in level. If the check is failed, the character must spend another week in training. At the end of this time, another check is made, with a +1 applied to the character's Intelligence or Wisdom score. The results are the same as above, with each additional week spent in training giving another +1 to the character's ability score. This +1 is for the purpose of determining the success or failure of the check only. It is not permanent or recorded.",
										"One obvious result of the training system is the development of different academies that specialize in training different character classes. Because of their importance in the adventuring community, these academies can become quite powerful in the lives of the player characters. Imagine the disastrous effect should one of the player characters be blacklisted by his appropriate academy. Although the DM should not abuse such power, the player characters should treat such institutions with care and respect."

Each DM and his players will likely settle into a pace that best suits their group, without even realizing it.",
						"There is only one hard and fast rule concerning advancement: Player characters should never advance more than one level per time experience is awarded. If a gaming session ends and a character has earned enough experience points to advance two levels, the excess points are lost.

For instance, crouching behind a boulder improves a character's Armor Class, while being attacked from behind worsens his AC.",
						"Armor provides protection by reducing the chance that a character is attacked successfully (and suffers damage). Armor does not absorb damage, it prevents it. A fighter in full plate mail may be a slow-moving target, but penetrating his armor to cause any damage is no small task.",
						"Armor Class is measured on a scale from 10, the worst (no armor), to -10, the best (very powerful magical armors). {@i The lower the number, the more effective the armor.} Shields can also improve the AC of a character (see \"Shields\" in Chapter 6: Money and Equipment).",
						"Abilities and situations can also affect a character's Armor Class. High Dexterity gives a bonus to Armor Class, for example. But even a character with a Dexterity bonus can have this bonus negated if he is attacked from the rear.",
						"{@b Damage (D)} is what happens to a character when an opponent attacks him successfully. Damage can also occur as a result of poison, fire, falling, acid, and anything even remotely dangerous in the real world. Damage from most attacks is measured in {@i hit points}. Each time a character is hit, he suffers points of damage. It could be as little as 1 point to as many as 80 or more. These points are subtracted from the character's current hit point total. When this reaches 0, the character is dead.",
						"{@b Initiative} determines the order in which things happen in a combat round. Like so many things in the world, initiative is determined by a combination of ability, situation, and chance.",
						"At the start of each round of a battle, an initiative roll is made by both sides. This roll can be modified by the abilities of the combatants and by the situation. The person or side with the lower modified die roll acts first.",
						"{@b Melee} is any situation in which characters are battling each other hand-to-hand, whether with fists, teeth, claws, swords, axes, pikes, or something else. Strength and Dexterity are valuable assets in melee.",
						"{@b Missile combat} is defined as any time a weapon is shot, thrown, hurled, kicked, or otherwise propelled. Missile and melee combat have the same basic rules, but there are special situations and modifiers that apply only to missile combat.",
						"{@b Saving throws} are measures of a character's resistance to special types of attacks\u2014poisons, magic, and attacks that affect the whole body or mind of the character. The ability to make successful saving throws improves as the character increases in level; Dexterity and general mental fortitude aid in honing combat senses. Experience makes saving throws easier.",
						"{@b Surprise} can happen any time characters meet another group unexpectedly (monsters, evil knights, peasants, etc.). Surprise is simply what happens when one side\u2014a person or party\u2014is taken unawares, unable to react until they gather their wits. Their opponents, if unsurprised, are allowed a bonus round of action while the surprised characters recover. It's entirely possible for both sides in a given situation to be surprised!",
						"Attacking with surprise gives bonuses to the attack roll (see Table 35). A surprised character also has a decreased chance of rolling a successful saving throw, if one is needed.",
						"Surprise is determined by a die roll and is normally checked at the beginning of an encounter. Surprise is very unpredictable, so there are very few modifiers to the roll.",
						"{@b THAC0} is an acronym for \"To Hit Armor Class 0.\" This is the number a character, NPC, or monster needs to attack an Armor Class 0 target successfully. THAC0 depends on a character's group and level or a monster's Hit Dice (see Tables 37\u201339 on page 53). The THAC0 number can be used to calculate the number needed to hit any Armor Class.

Characters with Strength penalties always suffer them when using a bow. They simply are not able to draw back the bowstring far enough.

								"{@b Magical Items:} The magical properties of a weapon can also modify combat. Items that impart a bonus to the attack roll or Armor Class are identified by a plus sign. For example, a {@i sword +1} improves a character's chance to hit by one. A suit of {@i chain mail +1} improves the Armor Class of the character by one (which means you subtract one from the character's AC, changing an AC of 5 to an AC of 4, for example).

Thus, the unwanted litter from the aerie of a giant eagle could be scattered around the base of its tree, while the remains of a cave bear's kill could be found somewhere near the opening to its den.",
								"At the same time, animals (and animal-like monsters) often have a fascination with the strangest of objects. Packrats and magpies are known to carry off shiny objects, pet ferrets will carry off pennies and shoes, and birds will weave all manner of things into their nests. Thus it is possible for virtually any item of interest to be found in the lair of a creature.",
								"There won't be many items in a lair, since few animals make an industry of such gathering. However, the nest of a giant otter might include a set of leather armor and fine silks for bedding material, while the nest of a roc could have a magical rope woven into it.",
								"In the rarest of instances, the creature could actually eat its treasure, though hardly by design. This is most often the case for creatures lacking the limbs to separate the edible from the inedible and especially for those with voracious appetites. Sharks' bellies have been known to hold such strange items as license plates, suits of armor, hubcaps, and other indigestible bits of metal. In adventuring, such instances should be limited to beasts with massive maws (purple worms, killer whales, and gelatinous cubes).",

They may do so for social status or material comforts. Indeed, many normal reasons can be given. However, the reasons are not always clearly apparent.",

Dragons don't go into town and buy goods, and they don't pay builders to construct homes. They just don't seem to have any use for the vast sums of money they collect (and collect they do!).",
								"For dragons and other intelligent creatures, the DM must create more bizarre and alien motives. Dragons may hoard treasure because they are obsessive about such things. They may have the notion that they are the guardians and recoverers of those things of the earth. They may simply feel it is their right to possess all that they can. Within their own relationships, the size of a hoard may have some bearing on the perceived might of the creature. It could even be that the wondrous beauty of treasure items brings an inner harmony and peace to the creature.",
								"Even for those intelligent creatures with understandable motives, things are apt to be a bit different from normal. A hobgoblin society is vastly different from that of humans or most other player character races. Hobgoblins don't go to cities and spend money on palaces, fine drink, and elaborate gardens. Their expenditures are apt to be much more brutal or mundane. At the same time they do not have an economy as developed as that of human society. Perhaps they need vast sums of money because the price relationships are so bizarre.",
								"Weapons may be astronomical in price and armor outlandish. Powerful chieftains may demand regular gifts and tribute from their underlings. Such payments may be made eagerly since death is the alternative. Indeed such a system of gifting may be culturally ingrained, each warrior attempting to prove he is still fit to be a member of the tribe.",

								"Furthermore, he isn't going to trust his own guards, either, and so is likely to have the treasury rigged with at least one (and probably several) dangerous traps. Should he be so lucky, the chieftain will even have a trained guardbeast or two to discourage thieves.",

He may bury it where only he can find it. He may place it in a trapped and locked chest, preferably one that is chained to the wall or floor. This is not a society with an overabundance of love and trust, after all.",

There are two basic attitudes toward the making of magical items: The practical method and the fantastic method.",
								"{@b The practical method} says that magical item manufacture is somehow tied to common sense; the materials needed to make the item reflect the properties of the item being constructed, and the steps required are fairly welldefined.",
								"For example, a {@i potion of climbing} might require the hair of a climbing creature such as a giant spider or the legs of a giant insect. A {@i wand of lightning} bolts might have to be carved from the heart wood of an oak struck by lightning. {@i Petrification} might require the scales of a basilisk, a snake from a medusa, or a feather from a live cockatrice. {@i Fear} might require a drop of dragon sweat or the grave earth of a ghost. In each case, the relationship between the items needed and the object desired is relatively clear.",
								"Furthermore, the component items themselves are physical and understandable. They may be rare, but they can't be gathered without special preparations (other than those required for normal adventuring). In essence, the DM creates a \"grocery list\" that the player character must fill. The character goes out adventuring, seeking out the creatures or things that will provide him with the materials he needs.",
								"This method has advantages, not the least being that it simplifies the DM's task. When confronted by a player who wants to create some bizarre magical item, the DM need only list materials that seem appropriate to the magical effect.",
								"At the same time, however, the practical method can be abused by clever players. They may figure out that every monster encountered has a potential usefulness to wizards and so begin collecting tissue samples, blood, hair, organs, and more. They become walking butcher shops\u2014not at all what is desired!",
								"Furthermore, players expect to find shops specializing in magical materials, both to sell and buy their needed goods. This defeats the need to adventure for one's materials and ruins part of the role-playing involved in magical item creation.",
								"{@b The fantastical approach} takes a drastically different view of magical item construction. Here, when the player says, \"I want to create a {@i rope of climbing},\" the DM provides a list of impossible ingredients. It then becomes the player's obligation to discover the means to collect each ingredient.",
								"Thus, to make the {@i rope of climbing}, the DM could require a skein of unspun yarn, the voice of a spider, and the courage of a daring thief. The player would then have to discover the meaning of each ingredient or the means to produce it. This, in turn, could require more research and spells to accomplish the goal.",
								"For the {@i rope of climbing}, the player might solve it by finding a magical sheep whose wool is so thick it needs no spinning. This he could form into a rope, casting spells to give a spider voice so it can say a few words over the cord. Finally, he could trick a renowned thief into using the unfinished rope on a dangerous mission. After all this, the wizard would cast the spells necessary to bind the various elements and, {@i voilà}\u2014a {@i rope of climbing} would be the result.",
								"Folktales, myths, and legends are filled with instances of impossible tasks and impossible ingredients. To bind the Fenris Wolf of Norse mythology, the dwarves forged an unbreakable chain from such things as the roots of a mountain, the noise of a cat, and the breath of a fish. Folktales tell of heroes and heroines faced with impossible tasks\u2014to plow the ocean or make a shirt without seams. Hercules was faced with Twelve Labors, deemed impossible by others. Cullhwch (of Celtic legend) had to produce sweet honey without bees. If the player characters aspire to such ranks of heroism and wonder, surely they can accomplish deeds such as these.",
								"The fantastical method gives the campaign a high fantasy element, for such impossible tasks are part of the wonder and enchantment of such a world. Furthermore, it ensures that each ingredient or step will be an adventure. Wizards won't casually assemble their ingredients at the local magic supply warehouse. It also provides the DM with a means to control the time required (since assembling components can be quite a task) and a method for draining excess cash from the character's accounts.",
								"At the same time, players can perceive this method as too difficult and too restrictive. They may become discouraged by the DM's demands. To alleviate this, at least partially, the DM should balance the requirements against the potency of the item being created.",
								"{@b Combining the practical with the fantastical} is a workable alternative to either method. Not every magical item can be created by gathering the organs of creatures or the essences of rare plants, nor does each require the spellcaster to overcome the impossible.",
								"Simple and common magical items ({@i potions of healing}, scrolls with various spells, {@i wands of detection}) could require only that the proper things be brought together and ensorcelled. Powerful, exotic, and highly useful items (such as a {@i sword +1}) might test the spellcaster's abilities and resourcefulness, requiring that he solve puzzles and riddles far beyond the normal ken.",
								"The combination of the two philosophies can even be used to explain the fact that some magical items are so common and others so rare\u2014potions are everywhere, but {@i maces of disruption} are hard to come by. Potions require simple ingredients; maces require the moving of mountains."

						"Just because a spellcaster knows a spell, he isn't automatically endowed with the knowledge to create a scroll or potion of similar function. The processes and formulae used in each are different.",
						"A spell on a page in a wizard's spellbook is different from a spell contained on a scroll. The first requires memorization and may need components or gestures to activate. The latter needs only an utterance to be effective. A potion, ingested to be effective, is clearly a different form of the same thing.",
						"Because of these differences, a wizard must learn more of his art before attempting to make scrolls and potions. He is assumed to have attained the appropriate degree of training by the time he reaches 9th level. Even then the knowledge of how to create such items does not just leap into his brain.",

When creating a protection scroll, the wizard is limited to those protective spells that fall within the purview of his art, for example, protection from elementals, magic, and petrification.",

It must be from a strange and magical creature, perhaps one appropriate to the nature of the spell (the feather of a cockatrice for a flesh to stone, etc.).

They could also be complex in meaning\u2014the tears of a crocodile and a drop of water from the bottom of the deepest ocean, or a drop of mead from the cup of King Thyas blended with the lamentations of the women from the funeral of a great hero.",

								"After the character has gathered and brewed all the materials, he can begin the actual process of writing. Wizards must have their spell books at hand to guide their work, while priests and others must work on a specially prepared altar. The actual process of writing the scroll requires one full day for each level of the spell inscribed.",
								"Protection scrolls require six days of work. During this time, the spellcaster must be undisturbed, breaking only for food and sleep (and then for a minimum of each). If the spellcaster halts before the transcription is completed, the entire effort fails and all work done to that point is for naught.",
								"After the work is completed, the DM secretly checks for success. The base chance is 80%. This can be increased or decreased by the materials used. For every level of the spell, 1% is subtracted from the success chance, but every level of the spellcaster adds 1%. Thus, a 15th-level mage (+15) making a scroll of a 7th-level spell (-7), using papyrus (-5) and writing with a cockatrice quill plucked with his own hand (+5) would have an (80 + 15 - 7 - 5 + 5 =) 88% chance of success.",

The player can never be certain of the amount of space required even for the same spell on two different scrolls. A failed attempt to transcribe a scroll automatically fills the remainder of the page, although other spells successfully written before the failure remain. In this case, the cursed effect of the failed spell will not come into effect until that spell is read.",

								"Potions are primarily the province of wizards, although priests can prepare those potions relating to healing and cures. (Priests of other mythoi may or may not be able to prepare such potions, depending on the spell spheres available to them.) Healing and curing potions are beyond the ken of wizards.",
								"As with other magical items, the character must identify and gather the materials needed to brew a potion before he can begin work. The formula can be as straightforward or bizarre as the DM desires. It may require the blood of a rare creature, powdered gems, the sweat of a mare, or the breath of a dying hero.",
								"In addition, a potion requires a number of mundane ingredients. The basic cost of these ingredients ranges from 200 to 1,000 gp. The DM should decide this based on how common the potion is, its power, and the nature of the ingredients he has specified. A potion of dragon control is a rare item of great power and so should cost the full 1,000 gp. A potion of healing is a fairly necessary item, something the DM may want to be readily available to the characters. Therefore, it should be cheap, costing no more than 200 gp.",
								"{@b Wizards} must do more than acquire ingredients: They also need a complete alchemical laboratory. Potions are not something you can brew up over the kitchen stove! This laboratory must be furnished with furnaces, alembics, retorts, beakers, distilling coils, and smoldering braziers\u2014in short, all the trappings of a mad scientist's laboratory (circa 1400 AD).",
								"The basic cost for such a laboratory is at least 2,000 gp if all the skilled craftsmen are readily available to construct the equipment to the wizard's specifications. And this cost covers only the furnishings; the wizard must also have an appropriate place to put all these things and to conduct his work. Given the strange noises and foul smells that issue at all hours from such a laboratory, many a landlord may be less than willing to have his rooms used for such purposes.",
								"Once the laboratory is established, the wizard must pay 10% of its value every month to maintain the equipment, replacing things broken in experiments and minor ingredients that lose potency with age.",
								"{@b Priests} do not make use of a laboratory\u2014such equipment smacks of impious and heretical learning. Instead, the priest places his faith in greater powers to perform the actual transformations needed to blend the potion. As such, he uses an altar specially consecrated to the purpose. When constructing such an altar, the character must be ready to make some sacrifice of worth, either a monetary sacrifice or, even more significantly, a special service to his deity. Thereafter, the priest need only respect the altar as would be normal for his faith.",
								"{@b Creating the Potion:} With all this equipment assembled, the wizard or priest is ready to begin. The cost already determined, the time to brew, infuse, distill, decant, and extract the potion is measured in days equal to the cost divided by 100. During this time, the character must remain uninterrupted except for the normal needs of sleep and food. If the work is disturbed, the potion is hopelessly ruined as are all ingredients used in it.",
								"After the work is done, the DM secretly rolls percentile dice to determine if the potion has taken. The base chance of success 70%. For every 100 gp worth of ingredients, 1% is subtracted. For every two levels of the spellcaster (or fraction thereof), 1% is added to the base.",
								"If the percentile roll is equal to or less than the chance of success, the potion succeeds. If the potion fails, the spellcaster has unwittingly brewed either a deadly poison or a {@i potion of delusion}, at the DM's discretion. Of course, the player won't know whether a potion is good until it's too late. In any case, the wizard or priest is wise to label his creation, for there is no sure way to distinguish between different potions by sight alone."

						"Potions and scrolls are not the only magical items spellcasters can create. Other types of magical items can be made\u2014weapons, wands, staves, rods, rings, bracers, cloaks, and more.",
						"There are also certain items the player characters can't create. Artifacts, relics, books (except spell books), and intelligent weapons are the realm of the DM only. Such items can be found by the player characters, but never manufactured by them. This ensures that the DM controls certain elements that can appear only during the course of an adventure he designs.",
						"Furthermore, certain magical items have a particular racial connection, particularly the {@i dwarven warhammer +3, elven cloaks, boots of elvenkind, elven bows,} and certain types of hammers and axes. These items can only be fashioned by NPC dwarves and elves of particularly ancient age. The making and awarding of these items is the task of the DM only.",
						"Finally, the DM has the right to exclude from player manufacture any magical item he feels is too powerful or too significant a part of his campaign world. (For example, if all magical weapons in the DM's campaign are the product of an ancient civilization and the art of their manufacture has now been lost, he can deny the ability to create such items to the player characters.)",
						"These limitations notwithstanding, players should be invited to submit their own ideas for new or unique items. The possibilities for new items are limited only by the constraints of game balance. Perhaps the character wants an arrow that explodes in a flash of brilliant light or a wand that causes those touched to suffer amnesia.",
						"Using the same give-and-take process described for new player spells, the DM should have the player write up a description of the desired item. The DM studies this, alters it as needed, and discusses the changes with the player. When both are in agreement, the character can begin the actual process of research and construction.",
						"When a player announces his character's desire to construct a given item, it is not the DM's task to tell him whether this is within the character's capabilities or not. It is the DM's responsibility to decide the materials and steps needed to construct the item. The player can then have his character consult a sage, fellow spellcaster, or higher power to learn what he needs. In the process the character may discover he lacks the appropriate powers to create the item. This is one of the risks inherent in magical research.",
						"{@b Finding the Right Materials:} First the character needs appropriate materials. When constructing a magical item, no ordinary sword, stick, cloak, necklace, or whatever will do. The item must be extraordinary in some way. Weapons must be of high-quality craftsmanship. Woods must be rare, specially grown, or cut in a particular way at a particular time. Cloth must be woven to exacting specifications. The material itself may be of an impossible nature (a shirt without seams or a hammer forged in a volcano's heart and quenched in the deepest ocean).",
						"Often, the only way to ensure the appropriate vessel for the enchantment is for the spellcaster to fashion or gather the item himself. However it is obtained, the vessel should cost far more than a normal item of the same type. The price can range from 1,000 to 10,00 (or more!) gold pieces depending on the material.",
						"{@b Preparing the Materials:} Once the vessel for the magic is obtained, the character will have to prepare it. A sword may need to be dipped in rare acids to burn away impurities. Bone may need to be picked clean by giant ants. Wood could require soaking in rare oils and herbs.",
						"Though the item is, as yet, far from gaining any sorcerous power, this stage is vital\u2014failure here means the spell will fail to take. Normally this stage takes from two weeks to a month just to prepare the vessel. Additional ingredients at this stage will cost at least 500 gold pieces, if not more.",
						"{@b Enchanting the Item:} The spellcaster is now ready to begin the actual enchantment. Wizards must first successfully cast an {@i {@spell enchant an item}} (or have another do it for them) on the vessel according to the conditions described for that spell. Once he is finished, the wizard can cast other spells into the vessel, provide the last ingredients, or perform the final steps in the enchantment process (as defined by the DM).",
						"The character might have to take the enchanted item to the peak of the highest mountain to expose it to the rays of the dawning sun before it will be ready. He could have to immerse it in the distilled sorrows of nightingales. If spells are necessary, these, instead of expending their energies, are absorbed and transformed by the enchanted vessel.",
						"The spell that must be cast into the enchanted vessel is the one that matches the power desired. If there is no direct spell equivalent, a more powerful spell with essentially the same function can be cast instead. If there is no spell equivalent at all, the wizard must research the appropriate spell before he begins the process of making the magical item, or he must provide exotic ingredients capable of conferring the power on the item, whichever the DM decides.",
						"Thus, at this step, the wizard could cast lightning bolt on a wand to make it a {@i wand of lightning}, but he would have to research a new spell to create {@i gauntlets of Dexterity} (since no spell exists to improve Dexterity) or bathe the gauntlets in the bottled essence of hummingbird dreams (as an example).",
						"Finally, if the item is to hold its magic for more than a single use, a {@i {@spell permanency}} spell must be cast. This locks the trapped magic into the vessel, empowering it at the command chosen by the wizard. If the permanency is not used, the vessel only holds charges equal to the number of spells cast upon it.",
						"If all these steps have been performed correctly and without interruptions, the item will be created...maybe. The process is long and involved and there are many opportunities for unintended error. Thus, when all is said and done, a success roll must be made. The basic chance of success is 60%. Each level of the wizard adds 1% to the chance, while each spell, special process, or unique ingredient used lowers the chance by 1%. The DM can further adjust the percentage for any extra-special precautions or notorious shortcuts the character might take.",
						"If the check is passed (by rolling equal to or lower than the success chance) the desired item has been created. If the check fails, the item is cursed, although this may not be known until a much later time. The function of the item becomes perverted, the opposite of the character's intention. A cursed sword, for example, could lower the character's chances of hitting, while cursed gauntlets could render the wearer clumsy.",
						"A character can't seek to make a cursed item with the hope and intention that the process will fail (thereby gaining a useful magical item). The nature of magical failure is such that the desired result, spoken or unspoken, never occurs.",
						"For example, suppose Thibault the Younger, a mage of 17th level, seeks to make a powerful {@i sword +5}. Using the contact other plane spell and money, he learns the steps he must perform and the items he needs. His first task is to shape a sword blade with his own hands from the ore of Mount Lothrian, at the very center of the Dwarven Estates.",
						"He travels there, only to discover that the Dwarven Lords consider this iron a treasure above all others, not to be given out to aliens not of the blood. After much careful bargaining, the Dwarven Lords agree to allow him to undergo the Ordeal of the Pit, the rite of dwarven manhood. Thibault is lowered into the caverns where even dwarves are loath to tread, where, in a solo adventure, he barely escapes with his life. By the time he has recovered and healed, the dwarves hail him as one of their own and reward him with the ore he seeks. As an extra benefit, during his time among the dwarves, Thibault learns a few more tricks of bladesmithing, increasing his proficiency.",
						"Now Thibault has the ore and, on his journey home, stops by the Spring of Masters to get the second item he needs\u2014pure spring water. A short time later, he is safely home. There, he spends a month hammering, folding, quenching, and hammering again on the blade, spending 5,000 gp on the task.",
						"Finally the work is done and the blade is finished, the last step being to etch it in a bath of black pudding acid. According to the instructions he received, Thibault must next instill the blade with the power of purity. Just what this means is not exactly clear, but his finances are running low and he doesn't want to waste more time for investigation. He decides to have the blade consecrated at a local temple and then has a paladin lay hands upon it.",
						"All these steps completed, Thibault begins his spellcasting. For days he works on casting the {@i {@spell enchant an item}} spell. The spell succeeds. To make a +5 weapon he uses the {@i {@spell enchanted weapon}} spell, one for each plus. However, after four castings, the {@i {@spell enchant an item}} spell fades and Thibault must spend more time re-enchanting it. Once again successful, he casts the last enchanted weapon and then seals everything with a {@i {@spell permanency}} spell.",
						"The DM secretly makes a check for success. The chance is 60% (base) + 17% (Thibault's level)\u201312% (for the ore, hand-forging, etching, instilling with purity, enchanting twice, five pluses, and the {@i {@spell permanency}}) = 65%. The DM rolls a 45. The work is successful and the sword is finished. Needless to say, Thibault is not tremendously eager to do this again right away.",
						"{@b Clerics and other priests} can also make magical items appropriate to their calling. The process begins with the selection of an appropriate vessel of the finest or most perfect materials. Once the vessel is at hand, the priest must spend two weeks in meditation and purification ceremonies and then another week in fasting and purification. Then he must likewise purify the item and seek to invoke it with a small portion of his deity's grandeur. Fortunately, this step takes but a single day and night.",
						"Once this is done, the item is ready for the final plea. As it rests upon an altar, the priest must pray for the blessed sign that the deity will endow the vessel with the desired powers. Each day there is a 1% cumulative chance that the prayers will be heard.",
						"Once this step is completed, the item need only be sanctified and consecrated, unless it is to possess charges in which case the priest has 24 hours to cast the appropriate spells into the item. Should the task to be incomplete at the end of this time, the priest will once again have to seek his deity's favor before continuing the process (in other words, start over at the beginning).",
						"The priest is assumed to be perfectly faithful and true to his calling. Should this not be the case, in the DM's estimation, the process may fail or yield some result unanticipated by the priest. The enchantment may fail or the character's deity may curse the item in retribution for the priest's impudence in seeking favor so ill-deserved. The DM must judge the standing of the priest based on his previous actions and his current motives."

Once prepared, new charges can be cast into the item. One benefit of recharging an item is that each charge requires only the spells' normal casting time (not the {@dice 2d4} hours per spell level normally required by the {@i {@spell enchant an item}} spell)",
						"However, recharging is not without risk to the item. Each time the item is enchanted to recharge, it must roll a saving throw vs. spell (using the saving throw of the caster) with a -1 penalty.

						"For some items, particularly some staves, there are specific rules that define the effects of the item's destruction. Such cases are rare and the effects are devastating, so they are recommended only for those in the area. You might, for example, dictate that characters within 1 foot, 5 feet, or even 10 feet suffer {@dice 1d8} points of damage.",

								"Vastly more potent than the most powerful magical items are extremely rare items of ancient power and majesty\u2014artifacts, constructs of the utmost wizardly might, and relics, the remains of awesome powers and the greatest of holy men. These are items of great import and effect, so their use must be strictly controlled. The following absolute conditions are always in effect when dealing with artifacts and relics.",
								"The appearance of an artifact or relic must always be the basis of an adventure. These items should never be casually introduced into play.",
								"{@b Characteristics of Artifacts and Relics:} Each artifact and relic is unique. There can only be one of that item in existence in a given campaign. It appears in a campaign only when it has been placed there by the DM. These devices never form part of a randomly placed treasure and so are not on any treasure table. The DM must choose to include each particular artifact in his game.",
								"Artifacts and relics always possess dangerous and possibly deadly side effects. These effects are all but irreversible, unaffected by wishes and most greater powers. Artifacts can only be destroyed by extraordinary means.",
								"Artifacts and relics can never be transferred from one campaign to another. If player characters from another DM's campaign enter yours, they automatically do so without any artifacts they might possess.",
								"So, given all these warnings and admonitions, just what is it that makes artifacts and relics so potentially dangerous to use in a role-playing game?",
								"At the top of the list is the fact that, in game terms, artifacts and relics are nothing more than excuses for the DM to break any and every rule he cares to. Upon learning the proper command, an artifact or relic might allow a character to raise all his ability scores immediately to their maximum or turn an enemy's bones to jelly.",
								"The artifact might allow the character to {@i summon meteor swarms}, utter a power word, resurrect, or stop time once per day at will. He might be able to summon powerful monsters and easily bend them to his will. He could discover the power to dominate the minds of others, enslaving them to his desires. And this might only be a small part of what the artifact would allow him to do. In short, there is no limit to what you, as the DM, decide an artifact can accomplish.",
								"{@b Origins of Artifacts and Relics:} All of these items have been handed down from ancient times and have histories shrouded in myth and legend. An artifact has the same background and aura about it as, for example, King Arthur's Excalibur, the skin of the Nemean lion worn by Hercules, Pandora's box, the Golden Fleece, the sword, jewels, and mirror of ancient Japan, or the Hammer of Thor.",
								"These unique objects were once held and used by gods and mortals far greater and more powerful than normal men. Often these items existed for an express purpose\u2014to be used by a particular hero, to fight a particular foe. So closely associated is an artifact with a person, time, or place that its powers can seldom be fully used except by specific individuals who meet certain standards. A weakling could not hurl Thor's hammer, nor could just anyone command Baba Yaga's hut. An artifact may show its full powers only to deal with particular, very specific, threats or dangers. Artifacts have purposes, sometimes fulfilled long in the past and sometimes never-ending.",
								"{@b Introducing Artifacts and Relics into a Campaign:} Because the impact of an artifact is so great, you should use them only in the most earth-shaking adventures you can devise. You must always have a reason for bringing an artifact into your game. It should never appear just because you want to give the characters something bigger and better.",
								"If discovered at the beginning of an adventure, it should be the prelude to some great threat to the kingdom, empire, continent, or world where the item will make a difference. Rather than simply giving the item to the characters, you can introduce the danger first and then set the player characters searching for the artifact that will defeat or stem the tide of evil that threatens to oversweep the land. Alternatively, the player characters could be faced with the worst of all situations\u2014one in which the artifact is in the hands of the enemy and the players must get it away from them. Each of these creates an adventure or, more likely, a series of adventures centered around the device.",
								"Once the adventure is over, it is best for you to find some way to get the artifact out of the players' hands. In essence, the artifact was a MacGuffin\u2014the thing that made the plot go\u2014not something you want to remain in your campaign now that the need for the item is gone. This is very much in keeping with the nature of artifacts and relics, since they have a maddening habit of disappearing once their task is done. To leave the artifact in the campaign is to invite abuse by the player characters, perhaps for noble ends, but abuse all the same. There are, even in a fantasy game, \"some things man was not meant to know.\"",
								"Because of their grand impact and titanic significance in the scheme of things, artifacts should be used sparingly. There are only so many times the characters can save the world before it becomes old hat.",
								"Don't be too eager to introduce these items into play and don't bring them in too often. Artifacts and relics represent the epitome of magical items. They are going to lose a lot of effect if every king in every kingdom has one in his treasure chambers. If characters only find one artifact in their entire careers, it will be enough. Well-played for all its drama, it will lead to an adventure the players will remember for a long time to come.",

In this way, the players will never know what to expect\u2014not its shape, its history, its powers, or its purpose. All these things will make the discovery and use of the item more exciting. In addition, you will have the knowledge that you have created something major, perhaps the most significant thing, for your campaign. That is no small accomplishment.",

										"{@b History:} After you know what it looks like, create a history for it. This history will guide you in deciding what powers the artifact has and what it is used for. In this history, decide who created the item and what their reasons for creating it were.

										"{@b Corrupting Effect:} As if this weren't enough, all artifacts have a corrupting effect. Characters become suspicious of others and possessive of the item. They begin to see threats where none were intended. Ultimately they will turn upon their friends and companions, seeing them as scheming enemies out to destroy them and steal the artifact.",
										"As with the drawbacks, this effect is caused by the fact that the player character is not the one the artifact was first intended for. His personality is different, and no matter how great he is, he lacks the force of will of the great hero, arch-wizard, high priest, or demigod, who originally wielded the item.",

										"{@b The Hand of Vecna:} Seldom is the name Vecna spoken, and even then only in the most hushed and terrified tones, for legends say the shade of this most supreme of all liches still roams the world.",
										"Little is known of this being except that he eventually met his doom in some awesome conflagration\u2014or at least that his physical body was destroyed. Still rumors persist that one hand (and perhaps an eye) survived even this destruction.",
										"These rumors ascribe strange and powerful abilities to the Hand of Vecna, still imbued with the unquenchable spirit of Vecna. The Hand is variously described as large and small, but all accounts agree that it is extremely withered and blackened, as if from a burned body.",
										"The first recorded appearance of the Hand was during the Insurrection of the Yaheetes, 136 years after the passing of Vecna. With the overthrow of Paddin the Vain, leader of the clan, the Hand apparently disappeared.",
										"During the reign of Hamoch of Tyrus, the hand was discovered by the fisherman Gisel. For several decades he kept it as a curiosity, until he was slain by his brother who stole the artifact. The brother was waylaid en route to Tyrus and the Hand fell into the possession of the outlaw Mace.",
										"With a single gesture of the Hand, Mace is said to have struck down the gates of Tyrus and brought plague onto the royal house. Stories are told how he spent one night in the royal bedchamber where he was visited by the spirit of Vecna. Undoubtedly he changed, for the next day he ordered the execution of his former followers to appease the wrathful shade.",
										"In the 100 years of Mace's reign, the city of Tyrus grew in power, but it became ill-famed as the Slaughterhouse of the Western Shore. Mace (now styled Vecna the Second) was struck down by a Yemishite assassin when the power of the Hand inexplicably failed him.",
										"Since that time the Hand has appeared briefly in a number of widely scattered lands. Most of these appearances are unsubstantiated, but the corruption of the Paladin-King of Miro is a well-documented case. Foolishly fixing the Hand onto his own arm, the Paladin-King discovered too late that he could not remove it and in the end it destroyed him.",
										"For the Hand to function, it must be touched to the stump of an arm, to which it grafts instantly. The grip is immensely strong (19 Strength, no attack roll or damage bonuses however).",
										"At first, the Hand seems useful and harmless enough, but within it resides some portion of Vecna's evil spirit. Gradually the owner comes to believe he is Vecna. Good characters becoming cruel and malevolent; evil characters become the embodiment of corruption, eventually turning on their friends and allies.",
										"Suggested powers for the Hand include: {@i death ray} (no saving throw, once a day), {@i {@spell cause disease}} (100-foot x 100- foot area/2 times per day), {@i {@spell animate dead}} (1/day), {@i {@spell darkness}} (at will), +2 protection, {@i {@spell web}} (1/day), {@i {@spell disintegrate}} (1/ day), {@i {@spell regenerate}} 2 hp/turn, {@i {@spell lightning bolt}} (12 dice, 1/day), and {@i {@spell time stop}} (1/week).",
										"Aside from the fact that the Hand is corruptive, its other major drawbacks include the fact that it cannot be removed short of chopping off the arm and the fact that those who see the Hand will covet it, attempting to take it from its current owner. Finally, the Hand foresees the moment of its owner's doom and its powers will fail just at that given time.",
										"{@b The Rod of Seven Parts:} It is said that the Wind Dukes of Aaqa were the creators of this legendary artifact. Manifesting themselves upon the world at the battle of Pesh, where the powers of Chaos and Law arrayed themselves, the Dukes presented the Rod to the Captains of Law. In the battle, the Rod was supposedly sundered in the slaying of Miska, the Wolf-Spider, consort of the Queen of Chaos.",
										"The Dukes, to prevent the Rod's capture, snatched up the seven parts and scattered them throughout the world. Ever since, agents of the Queen have sought out the Rod. It is rumored that if she regains all the parts, she can return Miska to the realms of men.",
										"The original rod was said to be about 5 feet long, but the pieces are irregular in length. The parts go together in a specific order, the first being narrowest and each later piece increasing in diameter. Assembling the Rod is difficult, however, because the item is still protected by the Wind Dukes. Each section conveys a sense of the direction to the next piece. Pieces assembled to each other in the correct order will bond together; however, if any piece is placed out of sequence, it will instantly disappear, to appear randomly somewhere else in the world. Upon assembling the first three pieces, the owner will refuse to part with the item at any time, even when sleeping, eating, bathing, or engaging in other personal activities.",
										"Because it was once shattered, the Rod is fragile. There is a 5% chance that it will break apart (and be scattered by the Wind Dukes) each time its major power is used.",
										"Each piece of the Rod has a minor power. Suggested powers are: immunity to one attack form, {@i fly at will}, {@i cure light wounds} (1/day), {@i true seeing} (1/day), hold monster (1/day), double character's movement, {@i slow} (1/day). When completely assembled, the Rod can have major powers. Suggested powers are: {@i restoration} (1/day) and {@i shape change} (2/day).",
										"Created to the service of order, the Rod changes its user to an absolute follower of law, even more so than the most rigid lawful good. The character will feel compelled to intervene in all things to maintain the primacy of law over chaos, heedless of the effects for good or ill. Those not adhering to the Rod-holder's strict views are perceived as enemies. Once all the parts are assembled, the Rod also radiates an aura of fearsome, icy law affecting all within a 20-foot radius. When its major powers are used, those who fail to save must flee in panic.",
										"{@b Heward's Mystical Organ:} In the Fables of Burdock readers find mention of a musical instrument, an organ of large size and mystical enchantment. It was said to have been fashioned by Heward, Patron of Bards, to teach mankind the art of song and to bring wonder and joy into the world. Through its keys and music, the Patron was able to spread the gifts of harmony, composing, grace, and beauty. Through his songs, Heward watched over and protected the lands, guiding the weather to glorious sunsets, rain to fall on parched soil, bread to rise firm and fresh, children to be happy, and indeed protecting all that mankind now loves.",
										"Unfortunately, the Fables say, mice among the frets gnawed at the workings, causing sour notes to escape, giving voice to the harpies, sirens, and other evil creatures that entice and trap by song. Enraged, the Patron cursed the mice to remain forever lowly and meek of voice. Believing the Organ ruined, the Patron abandoned it (and took up the harp).",
										"The location of the Mystical Organ is unknown, but the legends of several great and powerful bards relate its discovery and subsequent loss. Oldenburg the Blind supposedly discovered it and from its keys learned the 9 Enchanting Lays whereby he won the heart of Princess Leir, daughter of the evil Fairie-Lord Marrad. Mad Ossam was supposedly stricken upon trying to compose a tune at the Organ. Cursed with the power of blight and despair, he brought baronies to their knees in his travels. Many a bard has claimed to have studied at the Organ, but these are certainly nothing more than the exaggerations of showmen.",
										"The Organ is a massive, immovable object. The pipes easily extended the height of a cathedral chapel. The keyboard has three different sets, and there are 27 ivory stops. Nine great pedals control the bass notes. Each pipe is sounded by a bound elemental of appropriate size. The stops, when arranged in different settings, alter the pitch and voice of each pipe, while the keys strike the notes. Age, disuse (for even an artifact of such delicacy must be tended), and the ravages of the spiteful mice have rendered many of the pipes, keys, and stops inoperable.",
										"To use the Organ one must play a tune upon it. However, this is a tremendously dangerous business since there are so many possible combinations of settings and notes. Prior research and faith in the gods must serve as a guide. (As an option, players can compose or at least hum a little ditty of their own when their characters attempt to use the organ.)",
										"When a tune is played, the magic takes effect. Just what magical result occurs is left to the DM. He should base this upon the quality of the playing, the tastefulness and mastery of the music, and the desires of the player.",
										"Theoretically, Heward's Mystical Organ can have as many powers as there are settings and tunes to be played. With such a broad range, the DM can create virtually any result. The press of a key may cause flowers or straw to rain over a small village 100 miles away, while a fugue may result in the sinking of several islands off the coast or the reshaping of the organist into a newt (especially if he hits a bad note).",
										"Unlike other artifacts (which possess powers the character must discover), users of the Organ should decide upon the effect they wish to create and then research the notes and stops needed to create it. The DM can, of course, alter the end result (mortals playing with the toys of gods seldom get what they really want) and a check should be made to see if any errors (a missed note or beat) occur in the playing.",
										"If an error is made, the DM can have drawbacks and unfortunate results prepared. Some of these can include: permanently {@i polymorphing} the player into a small lizard or insect, permanent deafness or madness, or immediate alignment change. The character could be endowed with a voice equal to a {@i horn of blasting} (so he can't speak without causing harm), or he might be forever compelled to speak in rhyme or in song. One or more levels might be drained by the Organ. All magical items within 100 feet could be permanently negated. The organist could be teleported to another planet, etc.",
										"In addition, the tones of the Organ, no matter how badly set or played, are of unearthly beauty. Whenever it is played, all hearing it (including the organist) must roll a successful saving throw vs. spell or be enchanted forever.",
										"Those so stricken cannot abide any other sound. Deprived of its tones, they despair and see no wonder or greatness (in either good or evil) in the world. Gradually, those enchanted take less and less interest in life until they finally reach the point where even the finest food is an anathema to them. These slowly wasting creatures are truly piteous sights.",
										"The location of the Organ is constantly changing. All the legends agree that it exists nowhere in the world, but in some misty other realm. Noteworthy too is the fact that those who leave its hall are never able to find it again."

						"First, an encounter must involve a thing, an event, NPCs (characters or monsters), or a DM-controlled player character. A meeting of two player characters (handled by the players alone) is not an encounter. It is an action between the players themselves.",
						"Second, an encounter must present the possibility of a meaningful change in a player character's abilities, possessions, or knowledge, depending upon the player's decisions. The keys here are meaningful change and player decision. For each character with 500 gp in his pocket, going into a tavern and spending three gp on drinks is not meaningful change.

Going to the tavern and spending three gold pieces on food and drink isn't much of a decision. Choosing to go bankrupt to learn what may or may not be useful information is fairly significant. The player is going to have to think about the choice. How badly does he want this information? How reliable is this informant? Does he need the money for something else\u2014like new equipment? Can he get a better price?",

								"Rupert reaches into his pocket only to discover that the gem he pried from a heathen idol is gone!

The dust cloud slowly moves on their direction, while the smoke dwindles. Moving their horses to a hollow, the watch the approach of the mysterious cloud from a thicket."
							]
						},
						"So, which of these four is a true encounter? Only the last one. The first didn't involve any player choice. The gnome is crushed, and there wasn't anything either player character could do about it. Not only is this not an encounter, it isn't fair. It could have been an encounter (with a trapped ceiling), if there had been signs beforehand (clattering stones, previous deadfalls, groaning stones) and if the gnome had been given the opportunity to act before the rock squashed him. The player choice could have been to heed or ignore the warnings and leap forward, back, or stand confused when the rock fell.",
						"The second had player choice, but it wasn't particularly meaningful or balanced. The player knew his character could win the combat so his choice to fight was insignificant. He knew the sword was less potent than the one he already had, so his choice not to keep it was, likewise, not a choice at all. The situation could have been an encounter if the orcs had actually been ogres concealed by an illusion or if the sword had special unrevealed powers. Either of these would have made the character's actions meaningful.",
						"The third situation has all the trappings of an encounter. There is meaningful choice and anything could happen next. However, this is a squabble between player characters, not something the DM has control over. It does not further the plot or develop campaign background. Indeed, such disharmony will only hurt the game in the long run. It could have become an encounter if an invisible NPC thief had done the deed instead of Ragnar. Rupert and Ragnar, eventually realizing the confusion, would have suddenly found themselves united in a new purpose\u2014to find the culprit. Of course, there would also be role-playing opportunity as Rupert tried to make amends while Ragnar remembered the insult!",
						"The fourth example is a true encounter, even though it doesn't seem like much is happening. The players have made significant decisions, particularly to stay and investigate, and they are faced by an unknown creature. They do not know what they face and they do not know if it will be for good or ill. The dust cloud could be a djinni or a hostile air elemental. It could be a war-band of 100 orcs or giant lizards. The players don't know but have decided to take the risk of finding out.",

								"Static also means that events in one place don't affect things in another. If the characters heave the boulder out of the way, won't the noise awaken the ogre? Not according to the description as it is given, although a good DM would certainly consider the possibility. Writing a key that takes all these potential inconsistencies into account isn't easy. To be complete, you would have to design the key in your head, figuring out all the interconnections, before you wrote anything down.",
								"There are two solutions to this problem: You can try to be complete and thorough, preparing answers for every possible situation, or you can reduce the amount of detail you give about creature behaviors and improvise answers as you play. To describe a farmhouse, you could simply note the occupants (their ages and the like) and the significant possessions at the farm. The activity of the NPCs can be adjusted to the moment\u2014working in fields, sleeping, eating, etc.",

Improvising cuts down on preparation, but forces you to work harder during the game.

This way you are not overwhelmed in preparation or play."

Next, think like a player and try to anticipate what the characters might do. Would they aid the lady? If so, you will need combat information\u2014how the attackers will fight and what weapons and tactics they will use. What happens if the characters try to sound the alarm or talk to the kidnappers? What will the lady say if rescued? At least a brief note should be made to account for the probable reactions of the player characters.",

							"name": "Characteristics of Random Encounter Tables",
							"page": 96,
							"entries": [
								"All encounter tables share certain concepts. Before you begin creating your own tables, some understanding of these basics is necessary.",
								"{@b Uniqueness:} Although one could create a single encounter table and use it for every situation, this is a grievous limitation on the wealth and detail possible in a campaign world. Encounter tables add distinction and differentiation to areas. Encounter tables can reflect conditions as basic as terrain or as complicated as entire social structures.",
								"This in mind, the DM should decide where in the campaign world each encounter table applies. A single table could be made for all deserts; a separate table could be made for the Desert of Shaar, which is noted for its fabulous beasts; a further table could be made for the ten-mile area around the Palace of Yasath in the Desert of Shaar, where the Emir of Yasath maintains patrols to keep the beasts at bay. Within the palace an entirely different encounter table would be needed, since the patrols don't tramp through the hallways and harems.",
								"Each table says something about the conditions in a particular area\u2014the level of civilization, the degree of danger, even the magical weirdness of the area. Although the players never see the entire table, such tables help the DM define for himself the nature of his campaign world.",
								"{@b Frequency:} All monsters have a frequency of appearance, whether given in the monster's description or assumed by the DM. Orcs are more common than minotaurs, which are seen more often than dragons, which, in turn, are seen more often than Tiamat, Evil Queen of the Dragons. Frequency of appearance is normally listed as common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and unique.",
								"{@i Common} creatures normally account for 70% of the local population. They may be more prolific or just more outgoing, more likely to show themselves to strangers.",
								"{@i Uncommon} monsters fill the next 20%. They are fewer in number and tend to be more wary of outsiders.",
								"{@i Rare} creatures account for another 7%. Such creatures are normally solitary, exceptionally powerful, or very retiring.",
								"{@i Very rare} creatures constitute only 3% of the population. They are truly exotic and almost always extremely powerful. They may be creatures who have wandered far from their normal range or whose magical nature is such that not many can possibly exist at any one time in any one place.",
								"{@i Unique} monsters are just that. They are individuals, specific and named. Such creatures should never be used on random encounter tables. They are reserved for planned encounters.",
								"The chance of an encounter is not determined solely by the frequency listing, however. The DM should also take into account a location's terrain or deadliness. A polar bear can be considered unique only in the tropics and is very rare at best even in the northernmost reaches of temperate lands. An orc living in the deadliest area of an ancient ruin, an area populated by a dragon, mind flayers, and medusae, would be very rare indeed (and very lucky to be alive). Frequency must be modified to suit conditions.",
								"Frequency must also be subservient to the conditions the DM desires to create. If the DM wants a valley filled with magical creatures of incredible deadliness, then rare and very rare creatures are going to be more frequent. A lost valley filled with dinosaurs defies the normal chances of encountering such beasts. Indeed, they could only be considered unique elsewhere.",
								"Furthermore, frequency does not mean characters will encounter a creature 70% or 20% of the time, only that it falls into a group that composes that percentage of the population. The percentages and ratings given are not demographic data; they are only guidelines.",
								"Several common creatures will compose the bulk of the population, so that the chance of meeting any particular type is less than 70%. The same is true for all the other categories. In the end, the chance of meeting a particular type of common creature is still greater than that of meeting an uncommon or very rare creature.",
								"{@b Logic:} The other significant factor restricting encounter tables is rationality. Everything on the encounter table should be justifiable for one reason or another. By requiring justification, the DM can quickly narrow his range of creature choices down to a reasonable number, in essence winnowing the chaff from the wheat.",
								"The first and easiest criteria are terrain and temperature. Camels aren't found in jungles: kraken don't crawl across deserts. Glaring contradictions of logic must be justified. Produce a woodland dryad in the middle of a barren waste and the players are going to demand some explanation. Worse yet, they may assume the encounter is significant to the adventure because it is so illogical, which may in turn throw your entire adventure off track.",
								"Even if the creature fits a given terrain, it may not be appropriate to the setting. Just because an orc can appear on the plains doesn't mean it should, not if those plains are at the heart of a fiercely guarded human empire. Out on the fringes where raiding bands could slip across the border would be a far more appropriate place.",
								"As important as terrain and temperature in assessing the logic of a random encounter is the character of the society the table is supposed to reflect. Balance what the players expect to meet with what would make a good adventure. At the heart of an empire, the characters would expect to find farmers, merchants, nobles, priests, and the like. The task for the DM is to find ways to make these seemingly ordinary encounters interesting.",
								"In wilderness areas and abandoned ruins, there may not be a particular culture to consider. However, there is a society of sorts or, more accurately, an ecosystem. This is often overlooked in dungeon settings. Just which creatures feed on which? What relationships exist that allow all manner of diverse creatures to live in the same place without annihilating each other? Does a creature's random appearance make sense with what the characters know about the place? Medusae make poor wandering monsters, since logic says there should be statues of their victims in areas where they live. To round a corner and run into a medusa who just happens to be strolling the caverns grates against logic.",
								"{@b Effect:} Finally, as DM, consider the role of the random encounter. Such an encounter is not a part of the adventure being told; it hasn't been worked into the plot and doesn't advance the conflicts. A random encounter should not be the most exciting event of an adventure. You don't want the players remembering only the random encounter and forgetting the story you worked to create!",
								"Random encounters provide breaks in the action and can build or release tension. The characters are galloping after the desperately fleeing kidnappers. Suddenly a flight of griffins, attracted by the clamor of the chase, swoop down, aiming to make a meal of the player characters' horses. The kidnappers may escape unless the characters can extricate themselves from the attack in mere moments! The tension level goes up.",
								"Random encounters can also wear the player characters down in preparation for a larger, planned encounter. The uncertainty of the encounters adds an element of risk for the players. Will the characters be strong enough? A random encounter should rarely cripple a party (unless they are in a sorry state to begin with), but each one should weaken them a little.",
								"It doesn't matter if the player characters win every random encounter, especially not if they are down a few more hit points, spells, and magical items after each. Just knowing they are not at peak form and that they have expended their abilities on wandering monsters makes the players nervous.",
								"For these reasons, you don't want to use the most powerful and significant creatures when creating random encounter tables. You certainly don't want to use creatures that are more powerful than those in the rest of your adventure! Random monsters should be less significant than those you have planned."

						"Three experts, the assassin, spy, and sage, require special treatment. Each of these, unlike other hirelings, can affect the direction and content of an on-going adventure. Used carefully and sparingly, these three are valuable DM tools to create and shape stories in a role-playing campaign.",
						{
							"type": "entries",

							"page": 106,
							"entries": [
								"Assassination is not a discreet occupation per se, but a reprehensible mind-set. The assassin requires no special skills, though fighting, stealth, and even magic are useful. All that is really needed to be an assassin is the desire and the opportunity.",
								"{@b Hiring an Assassin:} When a player character hires an assassin (which is not a good or lawful act), he is taking a chance. There is virtually no way to assure oneself of the reliability and dependability of such a person. Anyone willing to make a business out of murder is not likely to have a high degree of morals of any type. Clearly, this is a case of \"let the buyer beware!\"",
								"Once a character has hired an assassin, it is up to the DM to determine the success of the deed. There are no simple tables or formulae to be followed.",
								"{@b Consider the Intended Victim:} Assassination attempts by one player character against another should not be allowed. This type of behavior only leads to bitterness, bickering, and anger among the players. NPC-sponsored assassination attempts against player characters should be used sparingly, and then only as plot motivators, not as punishment or player controls. Any time a player character is targeted, role-play the encounter fairly\u2014give the PC a chance.",
								"If the intended victim is an NPC, the DM should decide the effect of the assassination on his game. Sometimes, player characters do these things out of spite. At other times the deed may be motivated by simple greed. Neither of these is a particularly good motive to encourage in a campaign.",
								"If the death of the NPC would result in a major reworking of the campaign for no good reason, consider seriously the idea of making the attempt fail. If the death of the NPC would allow the player characters to by-pass or breeze through an adventure you have planned, then it's not a good idea. Don't just tell the players, \"Oh, that'd be bad for the game so you can't even try to knock that guy off.\" Work the attempt\u2014and its failure\u2014into the storyline.",
								"{@b Precautions:} If you decide the attempt is legitimate, consider the precautions the intended NPC victim normally takes. These may make the job particularly difficult or easy. Kings, emperors, high priests, and other important officials tend to be very cautious and well-protected. Wizards, with wise magical precautions, can be virtually impossible to assassinate! Devise specific NPC precautions before you know the assassin's plans.",
								"Wizards make use of {@i {@spell magic mouth}, {@spell alarm}, explosive runes},} and other trap spells. Priests often rely on divinationoriented items to foresee the intentions of others. Both could have extra-dimensional or other-planar servants and guards. They may also have precautions to foil common spells such as {@i {@spell ESP}, {@spell clairvoyance}, and {@spell detect magic}.} Kings, princes, and other nobles have the benefit of both magical and clerical protection in addition to a host of possibly fanatically loyal bodyguards. If the victim has advance warning or suspects an attempt, further precautions may be taken, and the job can become even more difficult.",
								"{@b The Plan:} After you have decided (secretly) what precautions are reasonable, have the player describe the plan he thinks would work best. This can be simple or involved, depending on the cunning of the player. This is the plan the assassin, not the player character, will use, therefore the player can presume some resources not available to the player character. However, you must decide if these resources are reasonable and truly exist.",
								"For example, if the player says the assassin has a map of the castle, you must tell him if this is reasonable (and, unless the victim is extremely secretive and paranoid, it is). A plan involving a thousand men or an 18th-level thief is not reasonable. The player character hasn't hired an entire arsenal!",
								"Finally, compare what you know of the precautions to the plan and the success or failure will usually become clear. Ultimately, the DM should not allow assassinations to succeed if he doesn't want them to succeed!",
								"In general, allowing player characters to hire assassins should not be encouraged. Hiring an NPC to kill even a horrible villain defeats the purpose of heroic role-playing. If the player characters can't accomplish the deed, why should they be allowed to hire NPCs to do the same thing?",
								"Overuse of assassins can often result in bitter feelings and outright feuding\u2014player vs. player or player vs. DM. Neither of these is fun or healthy for a game. Finally, it is a very risky business. Assassins do get caught and generally have no compunctions about confessing who their employer is. Once the target learns this, the player character will have a very dangerous life. Then the player character can discover the joy and excitement of having assassins looking for him!"

								"While less reprehensible (perhaps) than assassins, spies involve many of the same risks and problems. First and foremost, a spy, even more than an assassin, is inherently untrustworthy. Spying involves breaking a trust.",
								"A spy, unlike a scout, actively joins a group in order to betray it. A person who can so glibly betray one group could quite easily betray another, his employer perhaps. While some spies may be nobly motivated, these fellows are few and far between. Furthermore, there is no way to be sure of the trustworthiness of the spy. It is a paradox that the better the spy is, the less he can be trusted. Good spies are master liars and deceivers even less trustworthy than bad spies (who tend to get caught any way).",
								"In role-playing, spies create many of the same problems as assassins. First, in allowing player characters to hire spies, the DM is throwing away a perfectly good role-playing adventure! Having the characters do their own spying can lead to all manner of interesting possibilities",
								"Even if NPC spies are allowed, there is still the problem of success. Many variables should be considered: What precautions against spies have been taken? How rare or secret is the information the character is trying to learn? How talented is the NPC spy? How formidable is the NPC being spied upon?",
								"In the end, the rule to use when judging a spy's success is that of dramatic effect. If the spy's information will create an exciting adventure for the player characters without destroying the work the DM has put into the campaign world, it is best for the spy to succeed.",
								"If the spy's information will short-circuit a well-prepared adventure or force the DM to rework vast sections of the campaign world, the spy should not succeed. Finally, the spy can appear to succeed while, actually, failing\u2014even if he does return with information, it may not be wholly accurate. It may be slightly off or wildly inaccurate. The final decision about the accuracy of a spy's information should be based on what will make for the best adventure for the player characters."

They require contact with travelers and access to libraries in order to gain their information. Roll for frequency only when you can't decide if such a sage is present. As always, consider the dramatic effect. Will the services of a sage further the story in some exciting way?",
								"{@b Abilities and Limitations} define specific limitations or rules effects. If this column is blank, the sage's knowledge is generally thorough on all aspects of the topic. One race only means the sage can answer questions that deal with a particular race. One region only limits his knowledge to a specific area\u2014a kingdom or province. The size of the area depends on the campaign. One plane limits the sage to the study of creatures, conditions, and workings of a single extra-dimensional plane. Where no limitations are given, the sage is only limited by the current state of that science or art in your campaign.",
								"{@b What does a sage know?} A sage's ability can be handled in one of two ways. First, since the DM must answer the question any way, he can simply decide if the sage knows the answer. As usual, the consideration of what is best for the story must be borne in mind.",
								"If the player characters simply can't proceed with the adventure without this answer, then the sage knows the answer. If the answer will reward clever players (for thinking to hire a sage, for example) and will not destroy the adventure, then the sage may know all or part of the answer. If answering the question will completely unbalance the adventure, the sage doesn't know the answer.",
								"Of course, there are times it is impossible to tell the effect of knowing or not knowing something. In this case, the sage's answer can be determined by a proficiency check, modified by the nature of the question. The DM can decide the sage's ability or use the following standard: Sage ability is equal to {@dice 14+1d6 | 14 plus 1d6} (this factors in his proficiency and normal ability scores).",
								"If the proficiency check is passed (the number required, or less, on {@dice 1d20}), the sage provides an answer. If a die roll of 20 is made, the sage comes up with an incorrect answer. The DM should create an incorrect answer that will be believable and consistent with what the players already know about the adventure.",

More examples can be found in books obtainable at a good wargame shop or at your local library. The more specific you make your soldier descriptions, the more detail and color can be added to a fantasy campaign.",
								"Clearly, though, this is a fantasy game. No mention is made in these rules of the vast numbers of strange and bizarre troops that might guard a castle or appear on a battlefield. It is assumed that all troop types described here are human. Units of dwarves, elves, and more are certainly possible, but they are not readily available as hirelings. The opportunity to employ these types is going to depend on the nature of the campaign and the DM's wishes. As a guideline, however, no commander (such as the knight of a castle) should have more than one or two exceptional (i.e., different from his own race) units under his command.",
								"{@b Archer:} This is a footsoldier, typically armed with a shortbow, arrows, short sword, and leather armor. In history, archers were known to operate as light infantry when necessary, but this was far from universal. Highland Scots carried bows, arrows, twohanded swords, and shields, but no armor. Turkish janissaries were elite troops armed with bow and scimitar, but unarmored. Byzantine psilos carried composite short bows, hand axes, and, if lucky, chain or scale armor. A Venetian stradiot archer (often found on ships) normally had a short bow, long sword, and banded armor.",
								"{@b Artillerist:} These troops are more specialists than regular soldiers. Since their duty is to work and service heavy catapults and siege equipment, they don't normally enter into combat. They dress and outfit themselves as they please. Artillerists stay with their equipment, which is found in the siege train.",
								"{@b Bowmen, mounted:} These are normally light cavalry. They carry short bows, a long sword or scimitar, and leather armor, although armor up to chain is sometimes worn. Historically, most mounted bowmen came from nomadic tribes or areas of vast plains.",
								"The most famous mounted bowmen were the Mongol horsemen, who commonly armed themselves with composite short bow, scimitar, mace, axe, and dagger. Some also carried light lances. They wore studded leathers or whatever else they could find and carried medium shields. Pecheneg horsemen used the composite short bow, hand axe, lasso, and light lance and wore scale armor. Russian troops carried the short bow and dagger and wore padded armor.",
								"{@b Cavalry, heavy:} The classic image of the heavy cavalryman is the mounted knight. Such men are typically armed with heavy lance, long sword, and mace. They wear plate mail or field plate armor. The horse is a heavy war horse and barded, although the type of barding varies.",
								"Examples include the early Byzantine kataphractos, armed with medium lance, long sword, banded armor, and a large shield. They rode heavy war horses fitted with scale barding. The French Compagnies d'Ordonnance fitted with heavy lance, long sword, mace, and full plate on chain or plate barded horses were classic knights of the late medieval period.",
								"In other lands, the Polish hussar was a dashing sight with his tiger-skin cloak fluttering in the charge. He wore plate mail armor and rode an unbarded horse but carried an arsenal of weapons\u2014medium lance, long sword, scimitar, warhammer, and a brace of pistols (although the latter won't normally appear in an AD&D game).",
								"{@b Cavalry, light:} These are skirmishers whose role in combat is to gallop in quickly, make a sudden attack, and get away before they are attacked in force. They are also used as scouts and foragers, and to screen advances and retreats. They carry a wide variety of weapons, sometimes including a missile weapon. Their armor is nonexistent or very light\u2014padded leathers and shields. Speed is their main strength. In many ways they are indistinguishable from mounted bowmen and often come from the same groups of people.",
								"The stradiotii of the Italian Wars were unarmored and fought with javelins, saber, and shield. Hussars were armed with scimitar and lance. Byzantine trapezitos carried similar weapons, but wore padded armor and carried a medium shield. Turkish sipahis, noted light cavalrymen, carried a wide variety of weapons, usually a sword, mace, lance, short bow, and small shield.",
								"{@b Cavalry, medium:} This trooper forms the backbone of most mounted forces\u2014it's cheaper to raise medium cavalry than heavy knights, and the medium cavalryman packs more punch than light cavalry. They normally ride unarmored horses and wear scale, chain, or banded armor. Typical arms include lance, long sword, mace, and medium shield.",
								"A good example of medium cavalry was the Norman knight with lance, sword, chain mail, and kite shield. Others include the Burgundian coustillier (brigandine or splint, light lance, long sword, and dagger), Persian cavalry (chain mail, medium shield, mace, scimitar, and short bow), and Lithuanian boyars (scale, medium lance, long sword, and large shield).",
								"{@b Crossbowmen, heavy:} Only rarely used by medieval princes, heavy crossbowmen are normally assigned to garrison and siege duties. Each normally has a heavy crossbow, short sword, and dagger, and wears chain mail. The services of a shield bearer is often supplied to each man.",
								"Venetian crossbowmen frequently served on galleys and wore chain or brigandine armor. Genoese men in German service sometimes wore scale armor for even greater protection.",
								"{@b Crossbowmen, light:} Light crossbowmen are favored by some commanders, replacing regular archers in many armies. The crossbow requires less training than the bow and is easier to handle, making these soldiers cheaper in the long run to maintain. Each man normally has a light crossbow, short sword, and dagger. Usually they do not wear armor. Crossbowmen fight hand-to-hand only to save themselves and will fall back or flee from attackers.",
								"Italian crossbowmen commonly wore padded armor and carried a long sword, buckler, and light crossbow. Burgundians wore a light coat of chain and carried no weapons other than their crossbows. Greek crossbowmen carried a variety of weapons including crossbow, sword, and spear or javelin.",
								"{@b Crossbowmen, mounted:} When possible, crossbowman are given horses, for extra mobility. All use light crossbows, since heavier ones cannot be cocked on horseback. The horse is unbarded, and the rider normally wears little or no armor. As with most light troops, the mounted crossbowman relies on speed to whisk him out of danger. An unusual example of a mounted crossbowman was the German mercenary (plate mail, light crossbow, and long sword).",
								"{@b Engineer:} This profession, like that of the artillerist, is highly specialized, and those skilled in it are not common soldiers. Engineers normally supervise siege operations, both inside and outside. They are responsible for mining castle walls, filling or draining moats, repairing damage, constructing siege engines, and building bridges. Since their skills are specialized and rare, engineers command a high wage. Furthermore, engineers expect rewards for successfully storming castles and towns or for repelling such attacks.",
								"{@b Footman, heavy:} Depending on the army, heavy infantry either forms its backbone or is nonexistent. Heavy footmen normally have chain mail or better armor, a large shield, and any weapons.",
								"Examples of heavy infantry include Byzantine skutatoi (scale mail, large shield, spear, and long sword), Norman footmen (chain mail, kite shield, and long sword), Varangian Guardsmen (chain mail, large shield, battle axe, long sword, and short sword), late German men-at-arms (plate mail, battle axe, long sword, and dagger), Flemish pikemen (plate mail, long sword, and pike), Italian mercenaries (plate mail, long sword, glaive, and dagger), Irish gallowglasses (chain mail, halberd, long sword, and darts), and Polish drabs (chain mail, scimitar, and halberd).",
								"{@b Footmen, irregular:} These are typically wild tribesmen with little or no armor and virtually no discipline. They normally join an army for loot or to protect their homeland. Their weapons vary widely, although most favor some traditional item.",
								" These are typically wild tribesmen with little or no armor and virtually no discipline. They normally join an army for loot or to protect their homeland. Their weapons vary widely, although most favor some traditional item.",
								"{@b Footman, light:} The bulk of infantry tend to be light footmen. Such units are cheap to raise and train. Most come from the lower classes. They are distinguished from irregular infantry by a (barely) greater degree of discipline. Arms and armor are often the same as irregulars.",
								"Typical of light infantry were Swiss and German pikemen (no armor, pike and short sword), Spanish sword-and-buckler men (leather armor, short sword, and buckler), Byzantine peltastos (padded armor, medium shield, javelins, and sword), even Hindu payaks (no armor, small shield and scimitar or club).",
								"{@b Footman, militia:} These are townsfolk and peasants called up to serve. They normally fall somewhere between irregulars and light infantry in equipment and quality. However, in areas with a long-standing tradition of military service, militiamen can be quite formidable.",
								"Some Italian militias were well-equipped with banded or plate mail armor and glaives. The Irish \"rising-out'' typically had no armor and fought with javelins and long swords. Byzantine militias were well-organized and often worked as archers (short bow and padded armor) in defense of city walls. The Saxons' fyrd was supposedly composed of the freemen of a district.",
								"{@b Handgunner:} This troop type can be allowed only if the DM approves the use of arquebuses in the campaign. If they are forbidden, this troop type doesn't exist. Handgunners typically have an arquebus and short sword, and wear a wide variety of armors.",
								"{@b Longbowman:} Highly trained and rare, these archers are valuable in battle. They are also hard to recruit and expensive to field. A longbowman typically wears padded or leather armor and carries a long bow with short sword or dirk. Historically, virtually all longbowman were English or Welsh, although they freely acted as mercenaries throughout Europe.",
								"{@b Marines:} These are heavy footmen who serve aboard large ships.",
								"{@b Sapper:} These men, also known as miners or pioneers, provide the labor for field work and siege operations. They are generally under the command of a master engineer. Normally they retreat before combat, but, if pressed, will fight as light infantry. They wear no armor and carry tools (picks, axes, and the like) that can easily double as weapons. They are usually found with siege trains, baggage trains, and castles.",
								"{@b Shieldbearer:} This is a light infantryman whose job is to carry and set up shields for archers and crossbowmen. Historically, these shields (or pavises) were even larger than a normal large shield. Some required two men to move. From behind this cover, the bowman or gunner could reload in relative safety. If the position was attacked, the shieldbearer was expected to fight as an infantryman. For this reason, shieldbearers have the same equipment as light infantry."

								"If the character is seeking a large number of unskilled men or soldiers, he can hire a crier to spread the word. (Printing, being undiscovered or in an infant state, is generally not a practical solution.) Fortunately, criers are easily found and can be hired without complicated searching. Indeed, even young children can be paid for this purpose.",
								"At the same time, the player character would be wise to do his own advertising by leaving word with innkeepers, stablers, and the owners of public houses. Gradually, the DM makes applicants arrive.",
								"If the player character is searching for a fairly common sort of hireling\u2014laborers, most commonly\u2014the response is equal to approximately 10% of the population in the area (given normal circumstances).",
								"If the position being filled is uncommon, the response will be about 5% of the population. Openings for soldiers might get one or two respondents in a village of 50. In a city of 5,000 it wouldn't be unusual to get 250 applicants, a respectable company.",
								"If searching for a particular craft or specialist\u2014a blacksmith or armorer, for instance\u2014the average response is 1% of the population or less. Thus, in a village of 50, the character just isn't likely to find a smith in need of employment. In a slightly larger village, he might find the blacksmith's apprenticed son willing to go with him.",
								"Unusual circumstances such as a plague, a famine, a despotic tyrant, or a depressed economy can easily alter these percentages. In these cases, the DM decides what is most suitable for his campaign. Furthermore, the player character can increase the turnout by offering special inducements\u2014higher pay, greater social status, or special rewards. These can increase the base percentage by 1% to 10% of the population.",
								"The whole business becomes much more complicated when hiring exotic experts\u2014sages, spies, assassins, and the like. Such talents are not found in every city. Sages live only where they can continue their studies and where men of learning are valued. Thus they tend to dwell in great cities and centers of culture, though they don't always seek fame and notoriety there. Making discreet enquiries among the learned and wealthy is an effective way to find sages. Other experts make a point not to advertise at all.",
								"Characters who blurt out that they are seeking to hire a spy or an assassin are going to get more than just a raised eyebrow in reaction! Hiring these specialists should be an adventure in itself.",
								"For example, Fiera the Elf has decided she needs the services of a spy to investigate the doings of her archrival. The player, Karen, tells the DM what she intends, setting the devious wheels of the DM's mind in motion. The DM plans out a rough adventure and, when he is ready, tells Karen that her character can begin the search.",
								"Not knowing where to begin (after all, where does one hire a spy?), Fiera starts to frequent seamy and unpleasant bars, doing her best to conceal her true identity. She leaves a little coin with the hostelers and word of her needs. The DM is ready for this. He has prepared several encounters to make Fiera's search interesting. There are drunken, over-friendly mercenaries, little ferret-faced snitches, dark mysterious strangers, and venal constables to be dealt with.",
								"Eventually, the DM has several NPCs contact Fiera, all interested in the job. Unknown to the player (or her character) the DM has decided that one applicant is really a spy sent by her rival to act as a double agent! Thus, from a notso-simple hiring, one adventure has been played and the potential for more has been created."

Consider how often player characters sell or give away the magic items they find during their adventures. Nonplayer characters will have about the same likelihood of selling (or giving!) powerful magic away. Offering to buy a charge from a {@i staff of healing} is just plain insulting. No NPC's reaction is going to be improved by the offer."

Poorly played, an NPC can easily be reduced to nothing more than a collection of numbers, spells, equipment, and automatic reactions\u2014a role-playing automaton. Vivid NPCs are much more than this. These characters, developed and acted by the DM, are complete. They have quirks, likes, dislikes, habits, ambitions, and desires. In one way or another they fire and remain in the imagination of the players",

								"{@b Habits:} Like physical traits, simple habits\u2014scratches his head, tugs on his beard, stares at the sky when talking, or mumbles\u2014can be used. The DM can actually act out these simple habits at the table, adding a visual element to the roleplaying experience."

								"For very important NPCs, hirelings, and henchmen, the DM is going to need more than just a single character feature. Saying that a hireling is greedy is not enough. It doesn't make him any different from all the other greedy NPCs the player characters have met.",

He may break into cold sweats and become nervous when the player character accidentally tempts him (\"Here, hold my horse while I go see what's making that noise.\"). Will he remain loyal or will his baser nature get the best of him? The answer to this question should come out through role-playing.",
								"Enough little questions like this\u2014and enough role-played answers\u2014will bring the NPC's true character into focus. And if the DM pays attention to the personality of the NPCs, the players will also learn and study those characters.",
								"{@b Creating an NPC Personality:} The best way to create a personality is to use whatever seems right and not worry about carefully constructing a background and rationale for the character. The DM has to keep careful notes about each major NPC, adding to it each play session. After several sessions, the NPC may have a complete background and personality, one that has come out little-by-little during play.",
								"Alternatively, the DM can prepare a personality in advance. This simply means he prepares some background notes before he begins to play that character. This is useful for powerful villains and important officials. However, during play, the DM should be flexible enough to change any part of the NPC's background that just doesn't work.",
								"To aid in the process of creating NPCs, Table 70 lists different types of attitudes, tendencies, and habits. These are organized into major traits, with similar characteristics grouped under each.",
								"The DM can choose a major trait and any appropriate characteristics; he can randomly determine the major trait (rolling {@dice 1d20}) and select appropriate characteristics; or he can randomly determine everything ({@dice 1d20} for a major trait, percentile dice for characteristics).",
								"For example, the DM randomly determines a hireling is careless, selects thoughtless from that sub-group and then rolls for an additional characteristic, getting cheerful. The end result is somewhat scatter-brained, happy-go-lucky person.",
								"This table is used to spur the imagination of the DM, although it can be used to create completely random personalities. However, random methods often lead to confusing and seemingly impossible combinations! If a result seems totally impossible or unplayable, don't use it simply because that's how the dice rolls came up. Whenever possible, the DM should decide the personality of the NPC!",

The best comparison is to thermal imaging equipment used by the armed forces of many different nations today. This special sense is limited to a 60-foot range. Within this range, characters can see the degrees of heat radiated by an object as a glowing blob translated into colors like a thermagram.",
								"If this definition is used, there are several things that must be considered. First, large heat sources will temporarily blind characters with infravision just as looking at a bright light blinds those with normal vision. Thus, those attempting to use infravision must make the effort to avoid looking directly at fires or torches, either their own or the enemy's. (The light from magical items does not radiate significant heat.) Second, the DM must be ready to state how hot various things are. A literal interpretation of the rule means that characters won't be able to tell the floor from the walls in most dungeons. All of it is the same temperature, after all.",
								"The DM must also be ready to decide if dungeon doors are a different temperature (or radiate heat differently) from stone walls. Does a different color or kind of stone radiate heat differently from those around it? Does the ink of a page radiate differently enough from the paper to be noticed? Probably not. Can a character tell an orc from a hobgoblin or a human? Most creatures have similar \"thermal outlines\"\u2014somewhat fuzzy blobs. They do not radiate at different temperatures and even if they did, infravision is seldom so acute as to register differences of just a few degrees.",
								"Be sure you understand the effects this optional definition of infravision can have\u2014there are dangers in bringing scientific accuracy to a fantasy game. By creating a specific definition of how this power works, the DM is inviting his players to apply logic to the definition. The problem is, this is a fantasy game and logic isn't always sensible or even desired! So, be aware that the optional definition may result in very strange situations, all because logic and science are applied to something that isn't logical or scientific."

Some people, arguing that there are visual organs that can apparently see into the infrared spectrum (using infravision), will also argue for other forms of sight able to see into other ranges of the spectrum. These can be included, if the DM desires. However, before adding these to his game, the DM had best have a firm grasp of the rules and, maybe, of physics.",
						"For example, just what would a character or creature with ultravision (the ability to see into the ultraviolet spectrum) see? Our eyes see objects because of visible light that is reflected off objects (except for a few objects, such as the sun, light bulbs, fires, etc., that emit enough visible light for us to see them). Infravision utilizes heat (infrared) energy emitted by objects, since almost everything emits infrared energy. The problem with infravision is that many objects, such as normal weapons and rocks, without internal heat sources, are at or very near the temperature of their surrounding and thus are nearly indistinguishable from those surroundings when using infravision. Ultravision (and vision utilizing x-rays, gamma rays, or radio waves) is useless since only stars and a few other celestial objects emit significant amounts of energy in these regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

A minor cause might be a strange odor, small noise, an object that disappeared when it shouldn't have, or a strange reaction from another person (who has been pushed, kicked, poked, etc., by the invisible character). Such a saving throw should be allowed for each new event. A wolf would get a save when it detected a strange scent, then shortly after when it heard a stick break, and finally a last chance when the character drew his sword from his scabbard. Furthermore, the acuity of the creature's senses and its general intelligence can increase or decrease the frequency of checks, at the DM's discretion.",

The result, especially for less intelligent creatures, may only be increased caution. Having scented the intruder, the wolf bristles and growls, protecting its cubs.

Time passed in previous adventures has little or no effect on the current session\u2014each session or adventure is distinct and separate. For example, in one adventure, the characters spend a few hours in the dungeon, get injured, have some success, and return wounded. The night's game session ends with them returning to their home base. At the next game session, the DM announces, \"A week or so has passed since you last went out. Everybody is healed and rested. People with spells can pick new ones.\" The DM has chosen not to worry about the passage of time in this instance. An entire campaign can be played this way.",
				"Here's another example: In one adventure, a group of characters travels for three weeks and has several encounters, ending camped outside some ruins. The next session starts after the characters have camped for five days, so they can heal their wounds. Several hours pass as they explore the ruins, but no one is particularly hurt when they return to camp, and the game session ends.",
				"The next session starts the morning after their previous adventure, everyone having gotten a good rest. The characters set out again. They spend a week on the road and arrive at a village. Here, the mage insists everyone wait while he researches a vital spell. Again, the game session ends. The next session begins two months later, after the mage has learned his spell and continues from there. Throughout all this, the DM is more or less winging it, estimating the time required and time spent.",
				"There is nothing wrong with this method, nor is it particularly unrealistic. Medieval travelers often stopped at friendly or safe heavens for long periods while on their way to a final destination. There was little pressure to hurry.",
				"Using this simple time-tracking approach frees the DM from many of the concerns of timekeeping and prevents some obstacles to the adventure from occurring. (\"We can't go on an adventure! We're all hacked up and have to heal.\") Most of all, it is easy.",

Therefore, it is easy to have a week's interval within adventures, since the time passed does not impact on the characters' activities. As characters reach higher levels, however, their ambitions grow and their adventures become longer. More precise time-tracking proves useful.",
						"More precise methods can become unworkable, however, when player characters split into small groups, undertaking separate, simultaneous adventures. If one group sets out on a long journey while the rest of the party stays in the city, their game sessions are going to be at very different time scales.",
						"In their first session, the city dwellers may go on a short dungeon expedition. Several hours of game time (the amount of imaginary time spent on the adventure) pass. The DM then has a session with the travelers, and they spend three weeks of game time in the wilderness during their game. There is now a game time difference between the two groups of three weeks minus one day!",
						"If the travelers return to the city at the end of their adventure, the group in town must suddenly be moved forward in time to catch up with them if both groups wish to adventure together. Fortunately, this is not a great problem. The DM can simply say, \"Three weeks have passed and you are all reunited again.\"",
						"united again.\" The city adventurers can spend those three weeks doing background work\u2014training, researching spells, making a minor magic item, building a house, etc. This is a good use of free time. However, if one of the city characters decides to join the travellers (perhaps using a teleport spell to catch up with them suddenly), the three-week difference becomes a problem. Was that character actually with the traveling group for three weeks without doing anything? Must he wait for three weeks before he can join them? What if the other characters in town want to adventure more during that time? At this point, keeping track of time (or having the players do it) becomes pretty important."

								"Although player characters should not be forced into the role of grooms, all animals do have some basic needs that must be provided for. However, each animal is different, so the requirements for each are listed separately.",
								"{@b Horses:} While strong and fast, horses are not the hardiest creatures for traveling. Horses need around ten pounds of forage and fodder a day. Furthermore, good quality mounts should be fed grain, such as oats. A heavy war horse can't survive the rigors of travel by grazing on grass. Characters who can't provide enough food of high enough quality will watch their horses weaken and die. Horses must also have water every day. This can become particularly difficult in the desert.",
								"During daily travel, horses must be allowed to stop and rest with regular frequency. During these stops the mount should be unsaddled or all packs removed. If this isn't done, little profit is gained from the rest. At night horses should be hobbled or tethered on a long rope so they can graze. If one or two are tied, the others will generally not wander off. Horses need not be shod, unless they walk mostly on hardsurfaced roads or rocky ground. Horseshoes should be replaced about once a month.",
								"{@b Ponies, Donkeys, and Mules:} These animals have much the same needs as the horse. One of their main advantages is their ability to survive by grazing. Well accustomed to grass, there is no need to provide them with separate fodder. Their happiness is such that saving throws vs. death made for double movement gain a +2 bonus. This does not apply to triple movement.",
								"The other great advantage of these creatures is their surefootedness. They can travel through rugged terrain at one less than the normal movement cost. Thus, low mountains cost only three movement points.",
								"{@b Camels:} Camels are either suited to sandy deserts (as in the case of the dromedary) or rocky deserts (the bactrian camel). It's worth nothing that dromedaries are ill-suited to rocky deserts, and bactrian camels aren't appropriate mounts in sandy deserts! Dromedary camels reduce the movement cost of sandy desert by 1 point. Bactrian camels have the same effect in rocky deserts.",
								"All camels march better by night, when it is cooler. Dromedary camels are able to withstand a few days of cold weather (the temperature drops drastically in the desert at night), and some bactrian camels actually live in freezing and mountainous deserts.",
								"Although camels can manage for long periods of time without water, they must be fed every day. They do not need special fodder so long as grazing is possible. On the average they should have water at least every four days, although they can be trained to do without for longer periods, even up to several months if green grass or leaves are available for grazing. Like horses, camels should be hobbled or tethered to prevent them from wandering off.",
								"{@b Dogs:} Particularly tough breeds can be used to pull sleds and sledges. Some are suited to cold weather and will withstand a great deal of hardship. They require at least a pound of meat a day, so characters should pack dried meat for the dogs. If necessary, one dog can be killed to feed the others, but this is not recommended. Beyond the needs of feeding, sled dogs tend to care for themselves fairly well, although the characters may have to keep certain animals separated to prevent fighting.",
								"{@b Elephants:} As can be expected, elephants eat a prodigious amount of fodder every day. In thickly forested areas, this can be supplied without reducing the beasts' already slow speed. Elephants can also be found in sparsely forested plains, though. Here, if left to graze for itself, the beast will move at 1⁄4 its normal movement rate. Except for the carrying capacity of the beast, the characters might as well walk at these speeds! Elephants should bathe (or be bathed) every day and will avail themselves of dust baths to keep biting flies away.",
								"It should also come as no surprise that elephants can't negotiate cliffs. They can bound down steep slopes\u2014indeed, it is the only time they go fast\u2014but only at great peril to themselves and their riders. If the beast fails a saving throw vs. breath weapon (used for general tests of dexterity), it stumbles, falls, and rolls the rest of the way down the slope. The fall may kill or severely injure the elephant; the choice is left to the DM. Elephants are affected only by the deepest mud, so the movement penalty for mud is ignored.",
								"{@b Yaks:} Yaks are suited to the cold regions of high mountains. While slow, they are sturdy, unaffected by the cold. Their sure footing allows them to reduce all mountain movement rates by one. They can survive by grazing on a meagre amount of grass. Yaks also provide meat and milk for travelers. They live in cool regions and cannot survive long in warmer climates since they are prone to collapse from heat exhaustion."

However, the standard load the beast can carry is tripled. The weight of the cart or wagon and driver is not considered for this, only the cargo.

This problem generally restricts wagons to travel between settlements, where roads and paths are common.",

No more than two horses can be hooked to a sledge. Horse-drawn sledges are effective only on hard-packed snows and ice and can ignore the penalties for these. Deep snow merely causes the horse to flounder and the runners of the sledge to sink, so no benefit is gained in these conditions.",
										"Dog sleds are normally pulled by seven to 11 dogs. When hitched, a sled dog's movement is reduced by 1⁄2. However, each additional dog adds one movement factor to the sledge, up to the maximum of movement of the animal. Thus a dog sled with seven dogs would have a movement of 13 1⁄2. Each dog can pull 80 lbs., not including the weight of the sledge. Due to their lighter weight and the sledge design, dog sleds can cross all types of snow and ice without penalty"

Indeed, the captain may even be speaking to him. However, a hearing check should be made to find out if the character can make out the captain's words over the fury of the storm. If the character were a little closer, the storm a little less, or the captain's lungs exceptionally strong, the character's chance of success would be increased.",
						"In all cases, hearing a noise takes time. The amount of time spent listening to the captain is obviously the time it takes him to speak his peace. Standing and hearing noise in a corridor or at a door requires a round, with the entire party remaining still.",
						"Furthermore, a character can make repeated checks in hopes of hearing more or gaining more information. However, once a character fails a check, he will not hear anything (even if he immediately makes a successful check on the next round) unless there is a substantial improvement in the conditions. The group will have to move closer, open the door, or take some other action to allow a new check.",
						"If a check is successful, the character can keep listening to learn more. This requires continued checks, during which the player can attempt to discern specifies\u2014number, race, nature of beast, direction, approaching or retreating, and perhaps even bits of conversation. The player states what he is trying to learn and a check is made.",

						"When creating their characters, all players come up with a number to open doors, based on their Strength. Must the characters make checks to see if they can open inn doors, the doors to their rooms, or a carriage door? Of course not. Under most circumstances, don't worry about the chance to open a door. Sometimes, however, there are doors the characters aren't meant to open. That's when the check becomes important.",
						"Doors can generally be divided into different groups. First are normal doors. These open when pushed or pulled because that's what they are supposed to do. The DM who requires a check every time the characters try to enter a tavern is misinterpreting the rules.",
						"The next group are those heavy, old, musty, swollen and rusted doors found in dungeons and ancient ruins. These don't open with an easy pull. The hinges may be frozen or the wood swollen in the frame. To open these the characters must make a check, yanking on the handle or giving the door a good shove.",
						"Finally, there are locked, barred, and ensorcelled doors, ones that are closed and sealed on purpose. These take a bit of doing to open.",
						"Every character has a chance to force open a door, but it is up to the DM to determine when it is appropriate to use this ability. The DM can legitimately allow the characters to force open a door held shut by a flimsy lock or rotted bar. An extremely heavy dungeon door, swollen in its frame may be unforceable. The characters throw their shoulders against it and just bounce. If picking a lock is particularly important to the adventure, then that might be the only way to open the door (short of stealing a key).",
						"One important note to remember is that if a monster opened a door and fled through it, the characters should be able to open the door with equal ease. The key here is \"equal ease.\" What is easy for a troll or hill giant may be quite a bit more than a gnome or halfling can manage! Frequent opening and closing will also affect the ease with which a door can be used.",
						"If a door fails to open on the first attempt, a character can try again\u2014there is no limit to the number of attempts, but each subsequent attempt will reduce the character's chance of success by one, as he grows more and more tired of yanking or banging on the door.",
						"Another common tactic players use to deal with uncooperative doors is to put multiple characters on it. Up to two people can attempt to force open a door at the same time (more than this and the characters tend to trip over themselves). The chance of opening the door is increased by half the lesser character's chance (with fractions rounded up). Thus, if Rupert opens doors on a 1, 2, 3, or 4 (on {@dice 1d20}) and Delsenora on a 1, 2, or 3, together they can open a door on a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (Rupert's 1\u20134 plus half of Delsenora's 1\u20133, rounded up to a +2 bonus).",
						"Resourceful characters sometimes go after doors in a big way, improvising battering rams to bash them in. The characters need a suitable ram (a stout log will do) and some running room to gain the full advantage of this method. Such a ram will enable the characters to total their chances to open the door. Even without the running room, the characters can swing the ram into the door. This allows more than two characters to apply their muscle at one time.",
						"Each character on the ram contributes one-half his normal chance of opening doors to the overall effort. Thus, Rupert (1\u20134), Delsenora (1\u20133), Tarus (opens doors 1\u20136) and Joinville (opens doors 1\u20132) would have a (2 + 2 + 3 + 1 =) 1\u20138 chance of bashing down the door swinging a ram into it. Their chance would be (4 + 3 + 6 + 2 =) 1\u201315 if they were able to charge the door full tilt with their ram.",
						"Of course, bashing down doors does have its disadvantages. First, the door is ruined and can't be closed behind the group. The characters will leave a clear path, one any pursuers can follow, and they won't be able to block their rear. Unless the site has regular maintenance, the DM should note on his key what doors have been destroyed for future references.",
						"Forcing doors open also tends to be noisy. Unless the door bursts open on the first try, creatures on the other side cannot be surprised. Even if there isn't anything behind the door, those nearby will be alerted (and if intelligent, may take action). Finally, the noise may attract unwanted visitors. The DM should immediately make a wandering monster check (if any exist in the area) each time a door is smashed down. Silently picking locks can have its advantages.",

								"In addition to all other types of doors, the arcane architects of most fantasy buildings like to include a few secret and concealed doors. These can range from simple priestholes to pivoting bookcases opening into hidden crypts. The only limit is your imagination.",
								"Secret doors operate differently from normal doors. First and foremost, they must be found. This isn't something that happens without effort (if it did, the door wouldn't be very secret!). With the exception of elves, characters must search for secret doors to find them.",
								"Searching a 20-foot section of wall takes about 10 minutes, during which the characters tap, thump, twist, and poke, looking for secret catches, sliding panels, hidden levers, and the like. The exact amount of time can vary according to the amount of detail on the wall. A relatively barren wall section will go fairly quickly, while one loaded with shelves, ornamentation, sconces, and other fixtures will require more time. A character can search a given wall area only once, although several characters can search the same area.",
								"Normally, when a character discovers a secret door, he has found the means to open it. Therefore, no roll must be made to open the door. In very rare cases, the character may discover that the secret door exists (by finding its outline, for example) but not know how to open it. In this case, a separate check must be made to open the door.",
								"Secret doors cannot be forced open by normal means although they can be bashed down with rams (at half the normal chance of success). Indeed, it is even possible for characters to see the secret door in operation and not know how it is operated. (\"You burst in just in time to see Duke Marask, the vampire, disappear from sight as the sliding bookcase swings back into position.\") In such cases, knowledge that the door exists will increase the chance of finding its opening mechanism by 1.",
								"It is a good idea to note how each particular secret door works and how it is concealed. While such notes have no effect on the mechanics of the game, they will add a lot of flavor and mystery at the expense of a little effort. Which is more exciting\u2014to say, \"You find a secret door in the north wall,\" or \"You twist the lion-headed ornament over the mantle and suddenly the flames in the fireplace die down and a panel in the back slides up?\"",
								"Furthermore, colorful descriptions of secret doors allow you to place the burden of remembering how a given door works on the player characters\u2014\"What, you forgot what to do to make that secret door open? Well, I suppose you'll have to search again.\" If used in moderation, this will help keep them involved in your game, encouraging them to make maps filled with all manner of interesting notes.",
								"A concealed door is a normal door that is purposely hidden from view. There may be a door to the throne room behind that curtain or a trap door under the rug. The door isn't disguised in any way or opened by secret catches; it is just not immediately obvious.",
								"Any search for concealed doors will reveal them, and once found they can be opened normally. Elves can sometimes sense concealed doors (if they make their die roll) without having to stop and search. No one knows how this is accomplished, although some theorize elves notice subtle temperature gradients when they pass near these doors."

						"Of all the afflictions that can strike is lycanthropy. While often considered a disease, lycanthropy can more properly be described as a natural condition, in some cases, or a curse, in others. In either case, it is immune to the effects of {@i cure disease} spells and powers. Freeing a character from the torments of lycanthropy is a more involved and complicated matter than just casting a single spell.",
						"True lycanthropy is neither a curse nor a contagion, but the ability, possessed by a limited number of species, to change into an animal shape at will. As such, true lycanthropes are not affected by the phases of the moon, darkness, or any other limitations on their changing abilities indicated in the folklore of werewolves. Neither can a PC be afflicted with true lycanthropy\u2014it is an ability limited to those species born with the power.",
						"However, one of the characteristics of the true lycanthrope is his ability to transmit a lycanthropic contagion to his victims. This is the dreaded lycanthropy of folklore. Once stricken, the victim falls under the sway of the moon, unable to resist the powerful change into a bloodthirsty beast.",
						"Whenever a character is wounded by a true lycanthrope, there is 1% chance per hit point of damage suffered that the character is stricken with lycanthropy. The DM makes this check secretly, since characters never learn of their fate until it is too late (although prudent characters may take immediate steps as if they had been affected). If stricken, the character suffers from this curse.",
						"Cursed characters suffer uncontrollable change on the night of a full moon and the nights immediately preceding and following it. The change begins when the moon rises and ends when it sets. During this time the character is controlled by the DM, not the player. Often, the character discovers that he has done terrible things while changed and under the DM's control.",
						"During the change, the character's Strength increases temporarily to 19, allowing him to break bonds, bend bars, and otherwise escape confinement. The changed character has the Armor Class, attacks, movement, and immunities identical to the type of lycanthrope that wounded him.",
						"However, the intelligence and alignment of the character are overwhelmed by an uncontrollable bloodlust. The player character must hunt and kill and generally chooses as his victims people he knows in his daily life. The stronger the emotion toward the person (either love or hate), the greater the likelihood the character will attempt to stalk and slay that person.",
						"Remember that during the period of the change the player has no control over his character. Neither will he be identifiable to his friends and companions unless they are familiar with his curse or can recognize him by some personal effect.",
						"At the end of each change, the character returns to his normal form (perhaps to his embarrassment). At the same time, he heals 10% to 60% ({@dice 1d6×10}) of any wounds he has suffered. While the character may know or suspect that he has done something terrible, he does not have clear memories of the preceding night. Good characters will be tormented at the thought of what they may have done, and paladins will find they have, at least temporarily, fallen from grace.",
						"Freeing a character from the grip of lycanthropy is not the simple task of casting a spell. A {@i cure disease} has no effect on the character. A {@i remove curse} allows the character to make a saving throw to free himself from the lycanthropy, but this must be cast on one of the nights when the actual change occurs. If the character makes his saving throw vs. polymorph, the lycanthropy is broken and will not affect the character again (unless, of course, he is infected by a lycanthrope once again).",

Initially, describe an item only in the most general of terms: wood, metal, cloth, leather, etc. Allow players to ask questions about the look, feel, and smell of an item. Likewise, do not simply blurt out the properties and powers of an item. Items must be held, or worn, or manipulated before revealing their secrets. Bards, sages, identify spells, and so on may be the best (and easiest) determiners of magical qualities, but experimentation and experience are useful and make for good role-playing.",

Other spells, notably {@i {@spell commune}, {@spell contact higher planes}, {@spell limited wish},} and {@i {@spell true seeing}} are useless. A wish reveals the general contents of a book, telling what classes or characteristics are most affected (not necessarily benefitted) by the work. A second wish is required to determine the book's exact contents.",
								"After being perused by a character, most magical works vanish forever, but one which is nonbeneficial to the reader may be attached to the character, and he will be unable to rid himself of it. If the work benefits another character alignment, the possessor is geased to conceal and guard it. As DM you should use your judgment and imagination as to exactly how these items will be treated, using the rules in this section as parameters.",
								"{@b Boots:} All magical boots expand or shrink to fit the wearer, from halfling to giant size.",
								"{@b Eyes:} Mixing eye types is certain to cause immediate insanity for 2d4 turns. Once this time has passed the character can (and should) remove one of the magical lenses!",
								"{@b Ropes:} Any magical rope which is broken or severed immediately loses its special properties.",
