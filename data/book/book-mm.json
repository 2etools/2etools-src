				"This hardcover {@i Monstrous Manual}™ was created in response to the many requests to gather monsters into a single, durable volume which would be convenient to carry. With the {@i {@book DUNGEON MASTER™ Guide|DMG}} (DMG) and the {@i {@book Player's Handbook®|PHB} (PHB)}, the {@i Monstrous Manual} forms the core of the AD&D™ 2nd Edition game.",
				"Every monster from the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM® Volumes One and Two are contained within, as well as a few creatures from later volumes. The monsters in the {@i Monstrous Manual} have been revised, edited, and updated. Statistics for many of the creatures have been corrected, new information has been added to many of the entries, and many monsters have been reclassified. There are some new beasts, as well. In cases of conflicting information, the {@i Monstrous Manual} supersedes all previously published data.",
				"Certain entries have been greatly condensed from MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM entries, to make this book as complete as possible without increasing its size or price. For instance, there is a full-page description of ravens in the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM appendix for the GREYHAWK® campaign setting; in this book, ravens are given only a few lines in the \"Bird\" entry. This provides enough information to use the creatures for a short encounter, and it allows a page to be devoted to another adversary.",
				"To find a monster in this book, flip through the pages or look in the index, which contains listings for the common name(s) of every monster in the book, referenced to the correct page.",
				"All of the monsters described here are typical for their type. DMs should note that unusual variations are encouraged, but they are most effective when they depart from the expected. Likewise, entries describe typical lairs for creatures, from the dungeon complexes they inhabit to the tree houses they build; changing the look of these can make a monster encounter unique.",

The third appendix is concerned with creating NPC parties."

Intelligent monsters will use the magical items present and try to carry off their most valuable treasures if hard pressed. If treasure is assigned randomly, roll for each type possible; if all rolls fail, no treasure of any type is found. Treasure should be adjusted downward if a few monsters are encountered. Large treasures are noted by a multiplier (x10, for example); this should not be confused with treasure type X. Treasure types listed in parentheses are treasures found in the creatures' lair.

				"When designing a monster, avoid extremes. It is a common mistake to make a monster incredibly tough for no reason. Really tough monsters are very rare! If a monster has an extreme ability or combat statistic, there should be a good reason. In the same light, fit the monster's abilities to its description. Players need a fair chance to anticipate what the monster might do. For example, a monster that can fly should have wings, or else usually be encountered aloft. If a monster will have a surprising ability, keep it to just one, and have a good reason for the surprise.",
				"Not all monsters have to be evil. There are many other reasons a monster can be dangerous without arbitrarily making it evil. For example, any creature will fight to protect its family or territory whether it is good or evil.",
				"Characters should be able to negoitate with or intimidate many creatures, but negotiating with a monster does not always mean giving it treasure. Most animals will put off an attack if tossed a free meal they can eat in peace; intelligent creatures have many different motivations. Try not to force characters into having to kill every monster they meet. If a monster is left alive after an enounter, it might be encountered again, and become a regular part of the campaign.",
				"{@color CLIMATE/TERRAIN:|1169a3} Restrict your monsters reasonably. As a rule, only tool-making creatures can be found in every climate or every terrain. Remember that the physical design of a monster should make sense for the climate and the terrain.",
				"{@color FREQUENCY:|1169a3} Monsters should not dominate the landscape unless your campaign plot requires them to. Most monsters avoid settled areas because organized groups of humans and demihumans tend to kill them.",
				"{@color ORGANIZATION:|1169a3} Give a lot of thought to this entry; it determines the group tendencies of the monster. A pack can be controlled by controlling its leader. A flock, on the other hand, has no leader, but it does have a pecking order.",
				"{@color ACTIVITY CYCLE:|1169a3} Most monsters need to rest. When are they out and about? When are they sleeping? These habits should make sense with the diet and climate/terrain of the monster.",
				"{@color DIET:|1169a3} What does the monster eat? Not every monster is a man-eater. A wild bull is just as dangerous as a tiger, but it does not eat meat. Remember, fangs and claws imply carnivores, tusks and horns imply herbivores.",
				"{@color INTELLIGENCE:|1169a3} Avoid the tendency to make monsters too intelligent or too stupid. A creature living in the middle of the jungle with no manipulative organs is not likely to be intelligent. Really high intelligence usually implies civilization, or at least sophisticated tools. On the other hand, monsters that must fight to survive must have enough intelligence or other natural ability to conquer their foes.",
				"{@color TREASURE:|1169a3} Treasure is usually collected only by intelligent creatures. An animal type may guard a treasure for another creature, but the treasure itself belongs to the intelligence that set it there as a guard. Monsters that care little for riches and magical items might still have some as a result of encounters, but things will be scattered and ill-kept, often rusting away to worthlessness. Intelligent monsters, on the other hand, will use their magical treasures to their best advantage -- which may be no help at all to the characters!",
				"{@color ALIGNMENT:|1169a3} This is a broad description of the moral and ethical tendencies of the monster. A creature of animal intelligence has no morals or ethics, and hence is of neutral alignment. In general, try to avoid extremes, unless these fit the monster.",
				"{@color NO. APPEARING:|1169a3} This includes such values as Hit Dice and Armor Class. They should match the physical description of the monster. A well-designed monster fights the way it looks. A small, fuzzy creature with big, soft eyes should not have 25 Hit Dice, an Armor Class of -8, and swoop through the air to attack. The amount of damage done should reflect the weapon being used. Avoid the tendency to give monsters excessive Hit Dice and damage capabilities. The DM is the only person who gets a kick from seeing a PC suffer 40 points of damage in one round; players don't find that amusing at all.",
				"{@color COMBAT STATISTICS:|1169a3} See Chapter 9 of the {@i {@book DMG}} to determine THAC0 for monsters.",
				"",
				"{@color APPEARANCE:|1169a3} Include in the physical description of the monster its size, weight, color (skin, hair, eyes, etc.), smell, noises, type of movement (graceful walk, shambling gait, etc.), typical clothing, and preferred weapons.",
				"{@color COMBAT:|1169a3} Include any special combat abilities or disabilities. Be sure to cover any basic strategies or tactics the monster might use. Remember, smart monsters use smart tactics. The strategies should reflect their natural advantages and disadvantages.",
				"{@color HABITAT/SOCIETY:|1169a3} How does the monster relate to others of its kind, and to strangers? When do they work together and when do they fight? How do they choose leaders and how do these leaders rule? What are the goals of these monsters? Where do they live and how does this affect their behavior? Do they use or make tools? If so, what types and how are they made? Why does this monster have treasure? How does it get it? What is the nature of the family, and how many live together? Does the monster have special guards or allies and how frequently are they found together?",
				"{@color ECOLOGY:|1169a3} This should include the types of food eaten -- as well as what eats them, if anything. Any useful by-products should be listed, such as fur or edible parts. You may list uses for magical items or spells. On the other hand, don't turn your monster descriptions into shopping lists. The PCs are heroes, not butchers or fur trappers. List other creatures that live in harmony with the monster or compete against it, along with information about the size and nature of its territory.",
				"{@color VARIANTS:|1169a3} If there are major subraces, they should be detailed here. This may be a stronger leader type, an inferior servant race, or a DM special, such as skeletons that hurl their finger joints like {@spell Magic Missile|PHB|magic missiles}.",
				"{@color XP VALUE:|1169a3} Guidelines for awarding experience are found in Chapter 8 of the {@i {@book DMG}}. Hit Dice Value Modifiers for psionic monsters are +1 if the creature has access to only devotions, +2 if the creature has both sciences and devotions.",
				"In addition to the Hit Dice Value Modifiers listed for monsters in the {@i {@book DMG}}, consider the following optional modifiers: +1 for any special movement which gives an advantage, not just flying; +2 for magic resistance over 50%, +1 for magic resistance of 50% or under; +2 for breath weapons which can cause more than 20 points damage per attack, +1 for other breath weapons.",

								"To avoid delays, create NPC parties before play. The tables allow such parties to be set up quickly and impartially, and the DM is encouraged to make any changes that will enhance play. The tables should be considered a starting point.",
								"A typical NPC party has 2-12 members\u20142-5 major characters and the rest henchmen or men-at-arms.",
								"{@b Characters:} The Character Subtable provides a typical party structure by limiting number and classes of the NPC characters encountered. Determine character race (20% demihuman) and demihuman multiclasses on the Racial Subtable (multiclass results can exceed the Character Subtable limits).",
								"{@b Character Level and Equipment:} These will usually be comparable to those of the player characters, but NPC level will rarely exceed 12th. Arms, armor, and equipment will be typical: a 1st level warrior would have scale or chain armor and minimal gear. At 2nd level, banded or plate mail is typical, weapons profuse, and equipment complete (much oil, holy water, mirrors, etc.). NPC magic will be used if a fight breaks out. Note that if the NPCs are defeated, their magical items will enter your campaign.",
								"{@b Character spells:} These are selected by the DM according to those most suited to the NPC party. Wizards are subject to the limits of spells known. Henchmen spellcasters are treated likewise.",
								"{@b Henchmen:} The major NPCs will have a total of 2-5 henchmen, up to the party size, with any remainder men-at-arms. If the encounter is below the 3rd dungeon level, all those with the major NPCs will be henchmen.",
								"Henchman class and race is determined as for the major characters. Major NPCs are assigned henchmen in order of Charisma, allowing for compatibility (e.g., a paladin would not follow a thief, nor would a ranger below 8th level have henchmen). A henchman's level is one-third of that of his master (round up or down). If the master's level is above 8th, the henchman has 1 additional level per 3 full levels of the master. Thus, a 5th level mage would have a 2nd level henchman, while an 11th level mage would have a 5th level henchman (4 + 1). Henchmen are armed much as major NPCs, though they are not as heavily armored. Their magic is assigned as for major NPCs, but is usually less powerful.",
								"{@b Men-at-Arms:} Little detail is needed for these other than hit points. They often have poor armor and few weapons: for example, studded leather, crossbow and dagger, or (at best) scale mail, shield, spear, long sword, and backpack. They are seldom found underground below the 3rd dungeon level.",
