						"Whew, another big project behind me! Never did I realize when I started work on the Tome of Magic that it would become such an undertaking. After all, it seemed so simple. At that point, I should have known better.",
						"It all started with a seemingly innocent comment, something like, \"There are a lot of gaps in the spell lists for wizards and priests. Maybe we should do something about it.\" I don't know if I said that, or if it was someone else's idea, but whoever said it was right. I knew they were right because I could see them clearly by the time the AD&D® 2nd Edition {@i Player's Handbook} was finished.",
						"These gaps were not yawning chasms in the game system. They were little things, like, \"Gee, it would be nice to have a spell that did X—or Y, or Z, or whatever.\" Sometimes they were things to help explain the weirdness people were always putting in adventures or little touches that would smooth things out for players and DMs alike. The {@i Tome of Magic} could be just the place to get some of these ideas into the AD&D® game system. Months later (because months always pass between the idea and actually doing the work), it was time to make all this real.",
						"That's when I discovered the warts on the great idea—two in particular. First, filling a book with a mis-matched collection of spells was not enough. How many variations on {@i fireball, lightning bolt,} and {@i confusion} did you really need? Second, a book of odds and ends didn't sound exciting for either a game designer or for the players. The Tome of Magic needed something—a hook—to make it interesting.",
						"As a result, the {@i Tome of Magic} is much more than just a collection of spells. There are many new ideas about the types and uses of magic in these pages—wild magic, cooperative magic, focuses, elementalists, and more. In the end, the {@i Tome of Magic} offers more than just spells—it gives breadth and range to wizards and priests. In many ways, it is a peek inside the Pandora's box of magic.",
						"On top of these concerns was a problem of mental health. If I alone had to fill all these pages with spells and magical items, I'd be writing from the nut-house by now. There was no way I could create all these new spells and remain sane. That's why there is a host of designers listed in the credits. Taking often the barest of my ideas and suggestions, these creative conspirators produced a wide variety of spells and items. After weeding out spells too similar in form and function, I can offer you the cleverness and diversity of six different designers, not just one! For myself and the other designers, we hope you find the Tome of Magic both entertaining and useful. Let it be your guide to just how much further wizards and priests can go in the AD&D game."

						"An apprentice stands in the laboratory of his ancient wizard master. The youth's eyes stray across tables cluttered with alembics, retorts, beakers, bat wings, and phials, and beyond to shelves of scrolls and books. A musty old volume, bound in cracked green leather with glittering silver hinges, catches his attention. His master is elsewhere, so the curious student pulls the heavy volume from the shelf and, with a puff of breath, blows away a thick layer of dust. \"Tome of Magic\" it reads, spelled out in silver leaf on the brittle cover.",
						"The apprentice can't believe his discovery. He's never seen this book before. What secrets has his master been keeping from him? What secrets will he discover inside? With trembling fingers, the apprentice opens the creaking cover.",
						"\"Ahem, O callow youth! Perhaps you are dissatisfied with my training and would like to seek another master!\" booms the master's voice from behind the apprentice. The youth startles and guiltily slams the cover shut. Turning, he smiles sheepishly at his master.",

Now tell me, what are the three Greater Gesticulations used in casting a light spell?\" The wizard deftly slides the tome back into place on the shelf as he speaks.",

						"With over two hundred new spells for wizards and priests and a host of new magical items, the question of how to use this book may seem fairly obvious to most players. It appears to be a simple matter of opening the pages, selecting spells and magical items, and tossing these into a campaign.",
						"Of course, it can be done that way, but players and DMs who take this route will miss many of the new possibilities and expansions the Tome of Magic has to offer. On the surface, the {@i Tome of Magic} may appear to be just a collection of spells and magical items. But it contains new game rules and information that goes much deeper.",
						"This volume introduces a new type of wizard magic, expanded specializations, new priest spheres, and new variations on priest magic. These rules have the potential to impact a campaign in a way greater than a first glance might suggest. To benefit the most from these expansions, the DM should carefully consider how to introduce and use the new rules."

						"In the game world of wizards, there are two significant additions—wild magic and elementalists. Wild magic is a strange, new type of magical power, just being explored and discovered for the first time. Wild mages are rare and exotic. Long before encountering such a wizard, characters may hear tell of a new type of magic in reports from travelers to distant lands. Of course, every adventurer knows that these reports tend to be exaggerated—more fiction than fact.",
						"The first appearance of a wild mage is best presented by the DM as a mysterious NPC. The wild mage may join the party briefly or may be the springboard for an adventure. He should not be a henchman or hireling, but someone who is the characters' equal or superior. This gives players the opportunity to experience the wonders (and terrors) of wild magic before immersing themselves in this new art. After the characters have learned something of this strange magic, wild mage player characters may be introduced, perhaps as apprentices of the same NPC. Gradually, these new mages will become accepted members of the campaign world.",
						"Elementalists can be introduced in a similar fashion, although their arrival is likely to be less mysterious. The first appearance of the specialization could be a small school or guild in a nearby town, established by an elementalist from distant lands (where such magic is common). The newly established wizard is likely to be looking for an apprentice; new characters are eligible to join the school. Of course, established mages may take an interest (both positive and negative) in his activities."

						"The introduction of new priest spheres can pose a logical problem in some campaigns—if an existing Power has influence in a certain sphere, why did his priests never have these spells before? Why do they wake up one morning and suddenly have access to spells never before seen?",
						"The DM can use several solutions to this question. The first is most effective for such esoteric spheres as Thought and Numbers. In this case, few (if any) existing Powers have access to these spheres. Instead, priests arrive (as did wild mages) from distant lands, spreading the word of their god. These NPC priests have strange powers never before seen. In some locations, they may be accepted, while in others, they may be driven out with vengeance. As new player characters are created, this \"new\" faith with all its advantages and disadvantages becomes an option.",
						"Another explanation, particularly useful for the spheres of War and Wards, is that the Power always had access to these spells, but never had the need to grant them. A deity of war could reasonably withhold spells of the War sphere until the threat of war exists. To introduce the War sphere into the campaign, the DM need only create a little border tension and massing of troops — the perfect background for many adventures.",
						"Certain deities may be too aloof or remote to become involved in the affairs of men until the need arises. This is particularly appropriate for the spheres of Law and Chaos. A shift in the \"harmony of the universe\" might warrant the attention of these Powers to \"set things right.\"",
						"The introduction of subdivisions in the elemental sphere can be effected in a similar manner. Foreign priests may enter the campaign region and introduce the concept, or existing priests might discover their own deities suddenly taking a more active interest in their spells. Conflict or rivalry on the elemental planes can be used to justify rigid adherence to a particular element. A fire god, feeling the rising power of a sea god, may enforce strict elemental selection to bolster the devotion of his priests.",
						"Of all the new priest material, quest spells are the easiest to introduce. These are given by the DM only when special conditions warrant. It is easy to justify that conditions have never yet warranted the need for quest spells."

						"Of all the new material in this book, magical items require the least effort to introduce. Many are simply treasures that can be discovered in a newly-won hoard. In this case, DMs are encouraged not to reveal all the powers of a newly-found item. Rather, the player should be forced to puzzle out an item's powers. For example, the characters find a magical quill. What does it do? How is it used? Answering these questions is a goal that players can set for their characters. After spending time, spells, and money on research and possibly more adventures, the characters may discover that they own a {@i quill of law}.",
						"Another effective and logical method for introducing never-before-seen magical items is for NPCs to possess these fascinating new devices. Thus, a wild mage might own a {@i rod of disruption} or an elementalist a {@i wand of corridors}."

						"Mages and magic, great and small, are a key element of a fantasy campaign. While endowed with considerable powers, there are still vast horizons for mages to explore.

								"One of the newest discoveries from the great lands of the Forgotten Realms is wild magic. Originally considered little more than the unfortunate by-product of an epic struggle among the gods of that world, the strange effects of the wild lands (as those areas affected by wild magic are known) have attracted the attention of many a curious or scholarly wizard.",
								"In general, two types of wizards are drawn to these strange areas. The first are the researchers: wizards devoted to the study of the theoretical underpinnings of magic. For them, the wild areas expose long-hidden secrets of the magical universe and give new insights into how magical energy functions. From their work have evolved the beginnings of a theory of random magic—one that defies the traditional schools.",
								"The second type of wizard drawn to the wild lands is far less rigorous and methodical. These spellcasters are attracted by the sheer randomness and uncertainty of the wild lands. Such mages seek to incorporate wild magic into their spells by combining traditional magic with the new theories of random magic, throwing in a dose of their own chaotic natures as an extra measure. These wizards are the true wild mages who have been seen recently in various lands.",
								"Although initially discovered and researched on Toril, the FORGOTTEN REALMS® campaign world, the art of wild magic has quickly spread to other places. Wild mages, through teleporting, spelljamming, planar hopping, and even walking, have carried the precepts of wild magic to lands and worlds far removed from Toril."

								"With the discovery of wild magic has come the appearance of wizards devoted to its study. Like their traditional specialist brethren, wild mages have thrown themselves into the intense study of a single aspect of magic. This has given them unique benefits and restrictions on their powers. Wild magic is so different from traditional magic that only those devoted to its study may cast wild magic; no wizard other than a wild mage may attempt to use the spells of wild magic.",
								"Wild mages are by no means specialist wizards—at least not in the traditional sense. Wild mages do not study within the confines of schools. Instead, their research into new theories of wild magic carries them into all different fields. Wild magic has strengths in some areas (particularly divination and evocation), but it is not confined to any single school of magic. The proponents of wild magic proudly trumpet their art's broad base and flexibility as its great advantages.",
								"Of course, these same advocates are quick to downplay wild magic's drawbacks. First and foremost, it is {@i wild} magic. On rare occasions, any spell can have dangerously unpredictable results, including backfiring or creating an entirely different effect from what was desired. More commonly, the magnitude of a spell—range, duration, area of effect, or even damage—may fluctuate from casting to casting. Spells cast by wild mages are inherently unpredictable.",
								"Only characters with Intelligence of 16 or greater are qualified to become wild mages. The theories of wild magic are breaking new ground, and only characters of high intelligence are able to decipher the arcane convolutions of its meta-mathematical theory. Although wild magic is chaotic on the surface, study in this field requires diligence and discipline.",
								"There are no restrictions to the alignment of a wild mage. The race of a wild mage is limited to those races with competency at magic; thus, only humans, elves, and half-elves can be wild mages. Gnomes have some magical talent, but lack the broad base of skills and knowledge necessary to master this new field.",
								"Wild mages must abide by the normal restrictions for all wizards concerning weapons and armor. They use the same THAC0 and saving throw values of traditional wizards. They progress in level according to the Wizard Experience Levels and Wizard Spell Progression tables (Tables 20 and 21 in the {@i Player's Handbook}).",
								"Wild mages have several abilities and restrictions. Like specialists, wild mages are able to memorize one extra spell per spell level. This spell must be a wild magic spell, although it can be from any school; wild mages have no opposition schools as do specialists.",
								"Wild mages receive a bonus of +10% when learning new wild magic spells and a -5% penalty when learning other spells. Because wild magic is somewhat \"fast and loose,\" wild mages can research new spells as if they were one level less difficult, decreasing the amount of time and money needed to create new spells.",
								"Certain magical items behave differently in the hands of a wild mage. This is due to his understanding of the random processes that power them. Most notable of these is the {@i wand of wonder}. The wild mage has a 50% chance of controlling the wand, allowing him to use charges from the wand to cast any spell he already knows (but does not need to have memorized). The number of charges used by the wand is equal to the number of levels of the spell desired. If the attempt fails, only one charge is used and a random effect is generated.",
								"The wild mage can control the following items 50% of the time, thereby allowing him to select the result or item instead of relying on chance: {@i amulet of the planes, bag of beans, bag of tricks, deck of illusions, deck of many things,} and the {@i well of many worlds.}",
								{
									"type": "entries",
									"name": "Level Variation",
									"page": 6,
									"entries": [
										"The most broad-reaching aspect of the wild mage's powers is his approach to spells. The wild mage's work with the principles of uncertainty affects all spells that have a level variable for range, duration, area of effect, or damage. Each time a wild mage uses a spell with a level variable, he randomly determines the resulting casting level of the spell. The spell may function at lesser, equal, or greater effect than normal. The degree of variation depends on the true level of the caster, as shown in Table 1: Level Variation.",
										"To determine the level at which the spell is cast, the player must roll {@dice 1d20} at the moment the spell is cast. The variation from the caster's actual level is found at the point where the character's true level and the die roll intersect. (True level refers to the current experience level of the wild mage.) If the result is a positive number, that many levels are added to the caster's true level for purposes of casting the spell. If the result is a negative number, that many levels are subtracted from the caster's true level. If the result is 0, the spell is cast normally. The variation of a spell's power has no permanent effect on the mage's experience level or casting ability.",
										"For example, Theos, a 7th-level wild mage, casts a {@i fireball}. He wishes it to take effect 70 yards away at the site of a band of advancing orcs. {@i Fireball} has level variables for range (10 yds.+10 yds./level) and damage (1d6/level). A die roll is made on the Level Variation Table with a result of 19, indicating a level variation of +3. The {@i fireball} functions as if cast by a 10th-level wizard (7+3) and easily reaches its target, causing 10d6 points of damage. If the level variation had been -3 (die roll of 2), the spell would have operated as if it were 4th level. In this case, the {@i fireball} would have fallen short since its maximum range would have been 50 yards (10 yds+ 10 yds 1d4).",
										"One additional effect can occur when casting level-variable spells. If the result from Table 1 is boldfaced, the caster has inadvertently created a {@i wild surge} in the spell in addition to the spell's effects. A wild surge briefly opens a doorway through which raw magical energy pours. The energy is incompletely controlled by the actions of the spellcaster. The result, often spectacular, is seldom what the caster intended and is sometimes a smaller or greater version of the desired spell. At other times, wildly improbable results occur. Songs may fill the air, people might appear out of nowhere, or the floor may become a pool of grease. Whatever happens, it is the essence of wildness.",
										"When a wild surge occurs, the DM must roll on Table 2. Unlike many other instances in the AD&D® game in which the DM is encouraged to choose a suitable result, wild surges are best resolved by random chance. Actively choosing a result biases the nature of wild magic. DMs are encouraged to be random and have fun.",

For example, if a mage were casting a wizard lock on a door and triggered a wild surge with the result \"Target changes sex,\" no effect would be visible, since doors do not have a sex (at least as far as we know).

A priest contacting the Power (with a commune spell or by prayer) might beseech the Power to grant him some exceptional magic to address the situation. The request for a quest spell must never be motivated by selfish considerations on the priest's part (such hubris is grossly offensive to any Power), and circumstances must be truly exceptional. The Power then considers the priest's request and responds accordingly.",
										"In game terms, the first condition translates to the DM using a quest spell as a plot device to spice up a quest for the priest and his party. The second condition translates to a player requesting exceptional aid for his priest PC followed by the DM's decision whether to allow this."

Sincere belief is the most important factor. While persons attending a service may be numerous, casual followers do not contribute to the effect.",

A focus is created by means of the spell {@i focus}.",
										"Once the devotional energy has been focused, the cleric or clerics can cast the spell to be amplified. Using the devotional energy gathered by the {@i focus}, the spell's effect is increased in area of effect and duration. The exact increase depends on the level of the priest who casts the {@i focus}. Such amplified spells typically affect a building (such as a church or hospital), group of buildings, or even an estate.",
										"The spell remains in effect as long as the {@i focus} exists. This requires a minimum number of worshipers and periodic renewals of the spell. Since the duration of a {@i focus} is long, these renewals often coincide with important festivals of the religion, when numerous worshipers are present to provide devotional energy."

These philosophers maintain that thought is and must be tied closely to reality. In effect, they believe that the thinker, the thought, and the subject of that thought somehow interact. Thus, thinking about an object or condition can sometimes cause a physical change in that object or condition.",

These spells inflict physical damage on an opponent or improve the combat abilities of the priest and several comrades. War spells, on the other hand, are concerned with aspects of large-scale battles other than direct infliction of damage: observation, identification, movement, morale, and the like. Few spells of this sphere inflict physical damage on the enemy.",

Units can be infantry or cavalry (ground or airborne), human or non-human, of regular or irregular formation. In general, they must be organized as a single unit and must be at least five individuals in number. These spells are generally useless in individual combat.",

Distances are referred to in linear inches (not game inches) and times are referred to in BATTLESYSTEM turns, but the DM is free to modify these statistics to suit combat outside the BATTLESYSTEM rules.",

In the case of the more militant war gods, a priest who petitions for these spells inappropriately or misuses them may suffer dire consequences."
