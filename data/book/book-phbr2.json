				"Yet it is also a world of color and laughter, lively parties and bustling markets. The thief, more than any other character class, practices his arts among his fellow men (or halflings, or elves, or whatever). He seeks the gatherings of population, the confluence of wealth and avarice, where treasures are there for the taking.",
				"To be sure, many a thief has proven his worth time and again in the darkest reaches of a forgotten dungeon, among the snowy peaks of the bleakest of wild vistas, or within the halls of a fortress or military camp. Quests into the wild contain as much appeal for the thief as they do for other characters. In fact, should the prospect of treasure appear significant enough, many a thief will lead the way in encouraging his companions to embark on such a mission.",
				"But when the adventurers return to the sheltering walls of their homes, wherever these may be, and rejoin the population, the thief is best equipped to find adventure there. And when such adventure is discovered, it is thiefly skills that are most often called into play.",

Indeed, it is possible and in fact quite easy to play a thief character without the information herein.",

If no guild is present, consistent information on other societal sanctions needs to be determined by the DM\u2014and the information must be available to players as well.",
						"Consequently, no portion of this book is prohibited to player viewing, nor is any part of it irrelevant to the activities of a good DM.",

						"{@b The Spy}, long a noble practitioner of the thiefly skills. Indeed, lockpicking, moving silently, hiding in shadows, and the like are all skills of prime importance to the Spy.",

And a few new rules cover areas of concern to thieves\u2014lethal and non-lethal poisons, for example, and how to determine the quality of workmanship used to build a lock or trap.",

As the only public route into the city's Golden Quarter\u2014home of all the wealthiest merchants, most powerful lords, and influential ambassadors in all the land\u2014the Highgate was usually guarded well.",

								"But Morto's reading ability was not the issue tonight. Instead, the guard's loyalty to the guildmaster was the force behind Morto's curt nod and his gesture ushering Geraldor through the Highgate. Geraldor fairly skipped through the great stone arch. He had entered the Golden Quarter!",
								"Now his movements took on the shadowy aspect of the master thief at work. Though he remained alert, he knew that the major obstacle had been passed at the gate. The hefty bribes offered to Morto and his associates had paved the way to riches. It only remained for Geraldor to haul those riches away.",
								"The wiry thief found the mansion that had been selected by the guildmaster. Family and servants all slept, and they had no dog. In a matter of minutes Geraldor had collected the lady's gems. He spent several more minutes seeking the strongbox, finally discovering it in a small, luxurious sitting room. He picked the lock and pulled out only the most valuable coinage, platinum and gold, before soundlessly slipping toward the exit.",
								"In the house he saw magnificent silver candelabra, a huge and obviously enchanted sword, and other wonders. All of these he disdained as too bulky for his current mission. After all, Geraldor was a professional!",

								"He saw Morto at the guardpost and nodded casually, passing under the great stone arch again on his way out of the Golden Quarter. Only then did he notice something wrong: Morto stood mute, with his hands shackled before him.",
								"At that same instant a heavy gauntlet fell upon Geraldor's shoulder and a massive arm propelled him into the stone wall of the gatehouse.",
								"\"What have we here?\" growled an unfamiliar voice. Terrified, Geraldor saw that it issued from beneath the shiny cap of a watch captain.",
								"\"J-just going home, m-my lord!\" he stammered, wriggling in a futile attempt to break away.",
								"The captain laughed, having already found and discarded Geraldor's fake pass. The man's gloved hands continued to poke through Geraldor's clothes and pouches, retrieving object after object, often with a low chuckle.",
								"\"The lady Allorana's diadem, I see\u2014perhaps she loaned it to you!\" The captain roared with hilarity, joined by the guffaws of a full company of guardsmen that Geraldor now saw in the shadows.",

It is for players of characters who attempt this perilous exchange of wealth, and to their Dungeon Masters, that this tome is intended.",

Tax collectors, for example, may steal from those who regard such claims as thievery. So do conquerors. But these are not AD&DÂ® thieves. While they may approach the category of bandits, their \"theft\" demands more fighting skill and aggression than stealth.",

Poor Geraldor has suffered the fate known to many of these wrongdoers as he is taken by the long arm of the law. But if that law did not exist, then Geraldor's task would become meaningless.",

The Vigilante is a dangerous foe for the Professional, in part because he is incomprehensible to him. The Mobster would seem to be the Professional's kindred spirit, but they are too tightly bound (in the Professional's opinion) by honor and family loyalty and such trash. The Professional is bound to no absolute codes, except perhaps a contract and a clean, efficient theft. He has honor and honesty inasmuch as it is necessary to maintain his reputation for dependability.",
								"The Professional's motivation is hard to pinpoint. Clearly it is neither justice nor loyalty; and he knows that greed, whim and the lust for fame can cloud judgement and lead to fatal sloppiness. Perhaps then \"survival\" would be the best description of the Professional's motive; though any Professional worth his salt does better than merely survive. Of all the archetypes, he is perhaps most likely to have a businesslike, middle-class background, though any of the others is possible. The Professional is usually based in a city, or wanders, and his services are usually for hire. He may be associated with a guild, but would prefer to be as independent as possible\u2014other people's involvement in his work is more often hindrance than help."

Ironically, the Vigilante trains himself in the very skills of the thieves he opposes; he comes to know their ways and their minds as though he were one of them.",

This is especially true in the case of locales where the leadership is a bit on the shady side itself, perhaps riddled with bribery, graft, connections with crime, and other such corruption. The Vigilante leads a dangerous life, for he can have many powerful enemies.",

Popularity might do little to ward off a powerful thieves' guild, but it can cow the more fearful of public officials into tacit approval of his extralegal exploits.",

This particularly happens in large cities, where there may be ghettoes of demihumans, or where thieves' guilds have purposely raised demihumans in their midst to take advantage of their races' special abilities and benefits, while suppressing natural and cultural inclinations (dwarven honor, halfling peacefulness, half-elven wanderlust, and so on).",

						"Most thieves go through a period of training and apprenticeship, as do legitimate tradesmen. They are taught by an established, experienced thief, who was taught by a thief before him. This goes back untold generations, to the earliest thieves who developed skills on their own and then shared them with partners and apprentices. Over the years the skills and techniques have been formalized and perfected, especially under the normalizing influence of the large and powerful guilds that have arisen.",
						"But not every thief is molded in this way. There are always others, known as \"lone wolves,\" who developed outside the \"system\" of the established underworld. They discovered and developed their larcenous abilities without the aid of a mentor.",
						"Many lone wolves resemble normal thieves so closely that they may be treated as the very same thing, as far as class, abilities and restrictions go.",
						"However, in some cases a lone wolf may turn out very different\u2014perhaps different enough to be considered a class unto himself. To design such a character, you may use the optional rules, \"Creating a New Class,\" in Chapter Three of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}.",
						"The emphasis of such a character should still be on thieve's skills, but it may be that not all of the traditional skills are present. And the character may have other unusual abilities as well, cultivated to assist in his roguish endeavors.",
						"Imagine, for instance, a self-taught pickpocket. He may have Pick Pockets, Move Silently and Hide in Shadows, and perhaps Climb Walls (to help get himself over fences or whatever when he is pursued by an observant and angry victim). But he could have no other thief skills; for his thieving lifestyle there was no need for them.",
						"Note how this would be different from a traditional thief specialized in pickpocketing (as in, for example, the cutpurse kit): Even though he specializes in the course of his career, the cutpurse received a core training that included all the thief traditional skills\u2014a liberal arts education in larceny, if you will.",
						"Lone wolves often lead dangerous lives. They must be very self-reliant, and they have to find their own contacts for scoping out jobs and fencing stolen goods. As \"freelancers\" they run a constant and most serious risk of running afoul of monopolistic thieves' guilds.",
						"Guilds are often wary of lone wolves, who are more likely than \"established\" thieves, with trusted contacts and reliable references, to be spies for authorities or rival guilds. The lone wolf is also regarded by guildsmen with a mix of curiosity and contempt\u2014and sometimes even admiration, if his odd mix of abilities proves particularly useful \"in the field.\"",
						"A lone wolf, as we said, may be a character class unto himself. Most such classes never have more than one member, and when he dies his unique combination of skills is forgotten; the class ceases to be. On rare occasion a lone wolf may take an apprentice or two, and the class may be perpetuated in this manner. (If you are using the 1st edition AD&DÂ® game, you may suppose that the Assassin class arose in this manner.)",
						"Guilds who have accepted lone wolves into their ranks may ask the thief to take on apprentices\u2014but two things usually prevent this: One, conservative guildmembers typically see the lone wolf's unorthodox methods as a threat (because they are not understood), or as inferior to the traditional way of doing things; and two, lone wolves, used to doing things by themselves, are reluctant to share their secrets.

His master, Zalabom the Magnificent, was outspoken on a number of religious and political issues. One day his words went too far against the popular grain, and a mob dragged him from his tower, stoned him to death, and set fire to the building after looting it. Young Ajathar narrowly escaped with his life and a couple of texts of illusion magic.",
										"Homeless and hungry, Ajathar had to steal for a living. Assisted by what few illusions he could muster, he became a burglar\u2014and a surprisingly proficient one, considering that he was self-taught. As his burglary skills improved, so did his understanding of the magical arts of deception.",
										"He took as his symbol, his trademark to be left at each \"job,\" an illusionary blue hand. The illusion would fade after a few days\u2014but its discovery came to invariably bring panic to the heart of anyone who discovered it in his house. Sometimes Ajathar would not take a thing, but only leave the hand as a warning, a taunt, a mockery of a house's easily-penetrated defenses.",
										"Eventually Ajathar moved on. His native town, where Zalabom was killed, was neither affluent nor an exciting place for a daring young entrepreneur. \"Bluehand\" may therefore be found anywhere that the DM should wish to relocate him.",
										"One peculiarity of Ajathar's character is his strict adherence to the alignment of True Neutrality. The lesson he gained from Zalabom's death is that extremism and fanaticism in any form are dangerous and to be avoided.

								"This is going to be answered in heaps of useful detail in this section. But it's useful to have a basic working idea to start with. A thieves' guild is a grouping of thieves who agree to work together, in at least some ways. Often because of external threat and danger, it makes better sense for them to cooperate a little. This group typically has a leader\u2014a guildmaster\u2014or maybe a small ruling council. It has laws by which members must abide; there can be many of these, or few. A guild will usually only exist in a reasonably-sized town or city, where there is enough work for thieves. It will usually also have a central meeting-place, almost always secret; this is usually referred to as the guild house. Finally, it's also usually true that the large majority of these thieves are not of good alignment\u2014they tend towards neutrality at least, if not towards actual evil."

								"This chapter sets out to understand first what benefits a PC thief will derive from membership in a thieves' guild, and what responsibilities and duties he will have in return. This is a good place to start, for two reasons. First, it briefs the DM on luring the PC into guild membership so that instead of being onerous, it becomes interesting and rewarding. Dragooning a PC thief into guild membership isn't as good as the lure of the carrot (with the threat of the stick in the background...). Second, in looking at the \"rights and responsibilities\" guild members have, many of the functions of the thieves' guild\u2014its raisons d'etre\u2014become clear in the process. This helps to show why such guilds exist.",
								"This matter\u2014what thieves' guilds do\u2014is developed further in the next major section. The activities of the guild are divided into core functions\u2014what almost all guilds will do\u2014and secondary ones. Secondary functions may be carried out or wholly avoided, depending on the guild in question. These various activities are laid out for the DM here to make guild-designing easier later on. Players may also get ideas for sneaky and nefarious behaviors for their PCs here. Many \"secondary functions\" will relate to the specialized thief kits presented earlier. This section does not make explicit use of these kits, since different DMs will wish to handle these differently. However, developing specialist NPCs to fulfill these specialized activities is greatly facilitated by using the kits.",
								"Next, the relation of a thieves' guild with other groups is considered. These can vary from minimal to very highly organized indeed. The DM is briefed on major associations (with merchants, the law, other guilds) and the general social background to thief activities.",
								"Immediately before the section on designing guilds, there is the crucial issue of the power at the top of the guild. This is usually the Guildmaster\u2014or maybe a small group of dominant thieves, a ruling council. The personalities involved here will have a major effect on the personality of the guild, and need careful design by the DM.",
								"An extensive design section, complete with play-aid record sheets, is then provided to enable the DM to develop a thieves' guild for the major urban setting(s) in his campaign. This section uses a flexible approach to guild design. That is, there are tables which can be used for random determination of aspects of guilds, and dice-rolling alone will generate workable guild structures. However, the DM is encouraged to use a guided-semirandom approach, tailoring or omitting certain dice rolls and choosing design options which produce the most suitable and pleasing overall picture. This also covers the possibility that there is no formal thieves' guild, with design options for very loose affiliations or even relative anarchy!",
								"An example, the thieves' guild of Mallain, shows how to use the design system. This example takes an apparently contradictory set of dice rolls, and shows how to resolve them; the result is that the intrigues and tensions in the resulting Guild structure can be a focus for adventures for any PCs. The Guild becomes far more than just an anonymous body a thief PC pays dues to!",
								"A short section on unusual thieves' guilds (travellers on the road and others such) is followed by a valuable DM resource, a section on handling PC Guildmasters. The straightforward system laid out here handles guild income, hassles, arrests, trials and tribulations, followers arriving and leaving, morale, and the day-to-day business of running a thieves' guild. This should make life a lot easier for the DM!",

Below are detailed the most common benefits gained, although these will vary from guild to guild, with an example of one additional benefit typical only of membership in a certain kind of guild\u2014a highly organized and resourceful one!",

Having a PC train with a master, mentor, or tutor\u2014probably with others of his profession around\u2014allows many, many things to happen naturally without their obviously being spoonfed by the DM. Rumors and news can be caught up on. Hints and tips (e.g., concerning the usefulness of some of the new equipment items reviewed elsewhere) can be exchanged. New friends and contacts can be made. Intrigues and scams can be plotted, gossiped about, and initiated; employment can be offered; schisms and factions within the guild can become a focus for adventuring. All this is just for starters. Training is a natural way for the DM to enrich the game in all sorts of ways.",

New weapon and nonweapon proficiencies are the most obvious example. How can a thief who has never used a short sword, for example (because he has not previously been proficient with it), suddenly develop a proficiency in its use without training? This is obviously wholly unrealistic. How can a thief learn an Etiquette proficiency, enabling him to pull scams on the rich and haughty more easily, without a tutor to coach him in upper-crust, high society ways? He sure can't learn Etiquette from a dungeon crawl or wilderness hike! Likewise, if the player chooses to pile most of the 30 ``skill points'' gained for a level into one or two skills only, the PC could well need a specialist tutor to coach him in these skills\u2014a good way to bring in one or two of the specialist thief kits as NPCs, too.",
										"So, training is an important element of the game, and the thieves' guild is the place where the PC thief will have the best chance of finding a tutor to train him. He may have to wait a week or two, or maybe a little longer if the DM wishes this, but by and large the guild will go to some lengths to make tutors available."

Even with the Appraising proficiency, the thief's estimates may often be wrong, and a fair proportion of items too unusual or singular for the thief to be sure anyway. This is one area where the fence can help the thief.",
										"A resourceful thieves' guild will have members who can accurately value different sorts of items, and will also have contacts with certain specialists who aren't actually thieves but who also aren't terribly ethical either.

The Fence thief kit gives a basic design option for fences, and the blueprint profile section (later in this chapter) also details a highly experienced and versatile fence who can be used straight off the page (as it were) or developed by the DM for use in his campaign.",
										"A special case is that of magical treasure. A simple {@i {@spell detect magic|PHB}} spell from a mage-thief specialist in the guild, working with the fence, can tell a thief that the nice gold signet ring he filched from the drunk fighter is a magic item, worth far, far more than its value as gold. The same NPC can tell the thief (from an {@i {@spell identify|PHB}} spell) that the ring is a {@i {@item ring of protection|DMG +2}}, worth thousands. This only needs a 1st-level magic-user with the fence, but it's a priceless service for the thief!",
										"The other role for the fence, obviously, is that the thief gets \"hot\" property off his hands quickly. It will probably be out of town very fast, to be sold in some distant location where its illicit nature will not be suspected.

Multi-class thieves are also important people for many jobs\u2014a mage-thief with such spells as {@i {@spell invisibility|PHB}, {@spell levitate|PHB},} and {@i {@spell knock|PHB}} (to consider but second-level spells) is of obvious value. Having one accompany a thief on a robbery increases the chances for success considerably, but even if this isn't possible, a simple {@i {@spell invisibility|PHB}} spell precast on the hopeful robber gives an important edge for sneaking past guards and the like.",
										"Then again, other adventurers might be called upon. Depending on the guild's relations with other bodies, a cleric (with {@i {@spell find traps|PHB}}, among other spells) would be a most useful accomplice for many tasks. If the DM's campaign world has a deity which is an obvious patron for thieves (such as Olidammara of Oerth, or Mask of the Forgotten Realms), clerics of such a deity might well have very cordial relations with a thieves' guild. This is considered in more detail below.",
										"The guild can thus act as a clearing-house, with names and meeting places to assist a PC thief hoping to pull a job but needing help. Again, whether these contacts actually agree to help will depend on many things\u2014notably the reputation of the PC thief! However, the fact that they are there at all can be helpful for the PC thief, possibly for his friends as well, and can be very useful indeed if the thief PC wants to pull some job away from the rest of his usual adventuring group, when he must have some such extra help for success.",
										"Of course, a thief may simply need the assistance of others of his own kind for some job he has planned. This may be a simple decoy person to help with pickpocketing in the streets, or an eagle-eyed lookout for a warehouse job. Either way, the guildhouse may be a better bet than hanging around dubious taverns and hostelries. The flipside of this, of course, is that an impoverished PC can hang around the guildhouse touting for offers of work himself!",
										"Finally, a well-organized guild will even be able to help its members if they get into serious difficulties. A jailer may be bribed, a magistrate bribed or blackmailed, a man of law paid to plead the thief's case in the courts (if the judge or magistrate cannot be bribed). If the captured thief is very senior in the Guild, even a commando-style \"liberation\" may be possible! Such actions will leave the thief indebted to his guild for some time to come...",
										"So, these are the main functions of the thieves' guild, as far as a PC thief entering the guild can see them. There are certainly other things the guild will do, and we'll look at them in due course. Before that, let's look at the other side of the coin\u2014the responsibilities the thief has to the guild.

This is especially likely to be true with a strong guild, and in a lawful or repressive society where such actions may stir up a hornet's nest of trouble for the guild.",

A thief casing a joint for a later break-in might see an unusual number of guards around in the courtyard of an adjacent building as some crates are being taken inside from a wagon, and one crate splits slightly at the top revealing the glint of gold or ivory in the bright sun...The thief knows that he cannot organize a robbery over there as well as in the place he's casing already, so he reports the pleasant view to the guild. Doing so will certainly keep the thief in good favor. The thief will be expected to provide such information should he come across it, but the guildmaster might well reward particularly helpful guild members, mark them for promotion, give them a sinecure role in some other guild job, pay a small percentage of the guild take to the helpful informant, and the like.",

This is obviously going to be easiest if the identities of the snitches are actually commonly known within the guild\u2014how can you not poach a snitch if you don't know who is one, after all? But, because some thieves may be very nervous about this, the identity of certain really important snitches may be kept secret. The guild will protect them by warning thieves away from the key snitches indirectly (e.g., with an edict that no one is to try to \"make friends\" with the staff of such-and-such an establishment).

A notably busy thoroughfare, one where merchants and (especially) foreigners throng, is a patch which a skilled group of pickpockets will fight determinedly to keep as their own, exclusive territory. Protection rackets are another obvious case of a demarcated territory where other guild members do not stick their noses in.

At its most extreme, a city might in effect (if not in name) have several thieves' guilds, each controlling one section or quarter of the city, with the boss of each splinter faction meeting with the others at regular times to try to co-ordinate efforts and defuse tensions."

A busy working town along a trade route, though, might well attract several thieves, even if the actual population was fairly low. If the village relied on monies passing through the place (coaching inns, hospitality, markets, etc.), it would be much richer in terms of money available for the thieves to filch than a place with the same population but dependent on the turnip harvest!

										"The assassin kit earlier in this volume adds detail to this natural affinity. Going further, the multi-class thief is probably the strongest option for assassins. Combining the skills of the thief with spells such as {@i invisibility, jump, knock, levitate, rope trick,} and {@i sleep}, just to consider a few low-level spells, makes for a potent assassin indeed. The fighter/mage/thief has all these advantages, of course, plus the bonus of additional hit points, and is thus an especially attractive option, although progress is slow.",
										"So, given that many assassins are likely to be thieves, there will always be a fairly strong link between the two guilds. Cool relationships are possible if the thieves have \"gone respectable\" (become merchants themselves, etc.), or if the assassins are especially evil, ruthless sorts under a truly heinous guildmaster. Not unusually, though, the two will have at least moderately friendly relations. Information is quite likely to be exchanged between the two guilds, the guild seniors may meet occasionally to fraternize and discuss prospects, thieves may be paid to do spying groundwork for an assassin setting up a kill, apprentices of one guild who may be suited better to the tasks of the other may be exchanged; there are many ways the guilds can cooperate."

Beggars ply their trade everywhere, and some of them may just be sleeping off the effects of drink. If one is hunched up against packing boxes by a warehouse, so what? Anyway, no one wants to get too close to beggars. They have an unpleasant range of startlingly contagious diseases, and approaching them is an open invitation to lice to infest your person\u2014just for starters. And, of course, beggars are harmless (in the sense that they are too feeble, dim-witted, drunk, etc., to cause anyone any harm). For all these reasons, well-trained beggars are a real boon to the enterprising thief. They can get into places where other people would look suspicious, they often go unnoticed, and they don't have a lot to do apart from keep their eyes peeled. Just the people to have hanging around the places a thief intends to rob. After the job, the grateful beggars can be given a little percentage of the take.",
										"Beggary can even be semi-professional, in large cities in particular. Dominant beggars control lucrative patches of territory, where they know that pickings are richest. Fit and able-bodied people, their senses undulled by illness or drink, can pose as beggars for a better living (in a rich city) than they can make by honest means (e.g., as farm laborers). Such people would make excellent spies. A Guild of Beggars is by no means unlikely in many city settings. And, since children make very appealing beggars as they look soulfully up from their sad little eyes and beg for a penny for a poor orphan, such a guild will find and train such rapscallions. The more talented (dexterous and/or intelligent) ones may well be sold on to the thieves' guild, for a consideration, to become apprentice thieves."

								"Our DM is scripting the thieves' guild for the large town (or small city) of Mallain. The DM knows some basic social facts about this place, having placed it on the map in his campaign world, and records these facts for future reference. The issue of weak rulership is something the DM had decided in advance, likewise the fact that Mallain is in a civilized area of the country, and on a major inland trade route. The DM determines the population at somewhere around 17,000 (not too large, not too small!) and decides that 5% are halflings and 5% are half-elves; there are no full elves, and a smattering of dwarves and gnomes. The DM considers that there is a slight tendency toward lawfulness in the community, but not a strong one, so the overall social alignment is recorded as neutral.",
								"How wealthy is Mallain? The DM rolls a 7 on Table 7. To this is added +2, because the town is on a major trade route. The DM adds a further +2, since Mallain is a large town, if not a major one. This gives an adjusted total of 11, so the wealth level is average.",
								"The attitude of the law is resolved on Table 8, and a dice roll of 17 indicates tolerance. Why? One clear reason sticks out a mile: under-manning. The DM has already recorded that the ruler of the land is weak, and his militia is small in this safe, secure land. There simply isn't the manpower to go around chasing the thieves.",
								"The attitude of merchants is resolved on Table 9. A roll of 14, modified to 15 by the tolerance of the law, indicates a complex/mix. The DM isn't sure enough of how to script a complexity here; he isn't clear enough in his own mind about the details of Mallain. So he opts for a mix, and makes two more dice rolls on the same table to see what the mix is (adding +1 to each roll for the tolerance of the law). He rolls 12 (13, with a +1), which indicates a standoff; his second roll is 1, and even with a +1 modifier this indicates warfare! How to synthesize this into a whole? The DM reasons that most merchants are described by a standoff\u2014they put up with the thieves in a fairly resigned way. A minority, though, are furious about thieving for some reason; maybe they have suffered particularly heavy losses. This place isn't rich, after all. They try hard to persuade the ineffectual militia to do something about the thieves.",
								"Deciding on thieves and other guilds, the DM does not roll on Table 10 for assassins and beggars. The DM isn't happy handling assassins, so he decides there aren't any in town, obviating the need for a dice roll. With beggars, the DM wants to choose Close Cooperation, details of which he records. This is a plot element he wants to exploit later on. If the beggars spy on the merchants, facilitating robberies in a place of only average wealth, it could help explain why some of the merchants are at the end of their tether, too. Matters are beginning to come together fairly nicely, but there is lots still to do. How about bards? The DM rolls a 1, hostility! Very odd, and at this stage the DM just records this without thinking about why. He decides to come back to this problem later.",
								"From Table 11, the DM makes an initial recording of how many thieves live and work in Mallain. The population is 17,000. The DM rolls in the \"5001-10,000\" row, and twice in the \"Per extra 5,000\" row, in the Average (wealth) column. These rolls are 2d6+2, and 1d6+2 (twice) respectively\u2014a total of 4d6+6. This is rolled as a total of 19, but the DM adds 10% to this because the law is tolerant, for a total of 21. They need not all be guildmembers, of course; the DM needs to know about the guild rulership to determine this. Recording the figure of 21, the DM moves on.",
								"A roll of 5 on Table 12 shows that the guild is ruled by a guildmaster. From Table 14, the die rolls produce a picture of what this guildmaster is like. A first roll of 18 shows he is weak. A second roll of 12, reduced to 11 because of this weakness, makes him fairly cruel. A final roll of 12, reduced to 10 because of this cruelty, makes him fairly despotic. In summary: Weak, fairly cruel, fairly despotic. A rather pathetic creature, all told. This comes to the rescue of the DM when he rolls on Table 15 and comes up with a 20\u2014Anarchy!",
								"The DM is taken aback. There is a guild here, with a guildmaster, and now he is plunged into a real complication. He is about to re-roll the dice, but spends a minute or two in imaginative reverie. Perhaps, after all, this is workable. An old, feeble, weak, guildmaster has lost his authority. He has resorted to cruelty and despotism to try to hold on to his guildmaster status, but lacks the strength even to do this effectively. Guildmembers have drifted away in open contempt, but have not yet formed a separate guild (that would be Opposition, not Anarchy). They don't have the heart to kill the old thief, either (guildmasters appoint their own successors, the DM decides, so he'd have to be killed).",
								"The DM rolls on Table 16 before all this has sunk in\u2014if there isn't a guild, how can it have relations with outsiders and freelancers? But the roll of 19, Special Relationship, stimulates some further thoughts in the DM's head.",
								"The DM decides that the guildmaster has managed to hang on to a small rump of the guild\u20141d6, he decides, and rolls just 4. Later on, he will select these as being primarily senior and compatible with the guildmaster's alignment. There is no need for the standard percentile roll to determine the percentage in the guild, because this is a special and very unusual circumstance. The other 16 thieves all work independently, maybe allying with each other in small groups for the odd job now and then. Perhaps a lack of coordination among them means that some targets are hit too often, which wouldn't happen if the guild was coordinating matters properly. Maybe this is why some merchants are so desperate that they want warfare declared on the thieves\u2014this makes very good sense. It also explains why the law is tolerant\u2014they know it's going to be hard to track down and deal with any central organization which really cuts the mustard in Mallain, and the DM adds this detail to his notes.",
								"The \"Special Relationship\" is that holding between the rump of the guild, and the freelancers still in town. To complete the picture, though, the DM rolls another d20\u2014giving a result of 6, hostility. This is the attitude of all the thieves of Mallain (or most of them!) to outsiders from beyond the town, to complete the picture.",
								"The DM now has to determine the levels of the thieves in Mallain. There are 21 thieves in the town, and from Table 17 the DM determines the levels of the seniors as 8th, 6th, 4th (two), and 3rd. From the 5xd3 and 5xd2 rolls, another two 3rd-level and four 2nd-level are added. The remaining 10 thieves will all be apprentices. The DM records these figures on some rough paper.",
								"From Tables 18, 19, and 20 the DM makes die rolls to detail these thieves. There are 5% half-elves and 5% halflings in Mallain, but no full elves or gnomes, so the DM decides in advance to replace any elf rolled up with a half-elf, and any gnome with a halfling. Two thieves were not rolled randomly; the 8th-level human guildmaster, and the 6th-level half-elven thief the DM wants to use as a plot element to advance the theme of anarchy within the guild.",
								"The half-elf is a dashing, romantic rogue-figure who is the focus of the opposition to the ailing old guildmaster. He has musicianship skills, and a brother who is a bard\u2014hence one reason for the guildmaster's hostility to bards (this detail is added to the record sheet). This DM sees this character as very chaotic, and one who doesn't wish to be guildmaster. But the old guildmaster hates his charisma, youthfulness, and character, and has always blocked his progress. Now he sees him as the enemy who has drawn away the other thieves\u2014a special relationship indeed, a very tempestuous and intrigue-ridden state of affairs. Added to this is the fact that the half-elf doesn't want to be guildmaster, but the juniors who have deserted the guild are begging him to lead them in a coup against the old guard. He alone has the experience and charisma to do this. The DM has been watching a few Errol Flynn movies of late. However, while Evlarel the half-elf is chaotic good, the old guildmaster is Neutral\u2014it is too obvious and unsubtle to make him evil, which would submerge many of the intrigues into a simplistic good-versus-evil battle. But most of those staying loyal are evil\u2014if they have to be eliminated, the DM prefers them to be evil than to encourage his PCs to attack and kill neutrals.",
								"After this flight of fancy the DM comes back to earth. The guild is in a state of uproar and anarchy, but there are still some practical details to attend to. Guild dues still have to be decided\u2014these will be the old rates, which applied when the guild was not torn asunder, but they are useful as a guide to what the reformed guild (if it does reform) will accept. (The DM notes them in brackets.) A similar consideration applies to normal resources, but the DM also notes the present availability (poor) by way of an update. Special resources are important\u2014the DM determines that the thieves' guild has a government snitch, a personal friend of the guildmaster, and this stool-pigeon is used to prime the military to arrest the hapless half-elf, driving him further underground, and making him an even more elusive and mysterious figure. The war between old Halradur and Evlarel gets hotter by the moment.",
								"As for major activities, the DM decides that in such a fairly boring town as Mallain there is no scope for anything especially unusual. The declining guildmaster would not have had the strength of will to maintain any really nefarious activities. Individual thieves may kidnap, but the guild doesn't organize such actions. The guildhouse is located in the cellars of a local tavern, the DM decides; the Baron of Beef, run by one of the few thieves left who stays loyal to Halradur. This isn't a particularly creative design element, but the DM knows that matters are likely to be all-change in Mallain soon, and so can't be bothered to think up anything especially unusual. The tavern will make a good location for a final shoot-out in any event.",
								"What began as a short exercise in rolling up a thieves' guild has now turned into a powerful intrigue which could cast a long shadow over most aspects of life in this town. The central struggle between an old guildmaster, with a small evil coterie, and desperate young thieves looking to a reluctant new leader is going to enmesh the unwary PCs as soon as they enter the place!"

The gypsies will be extremely loyal to each other, and will usually be of Neutral (or chaotic neutral) alignment.

Thieves can make up the bulk of a traveling circus, which comes to towns and cities and cheerfully robs them. If the circus has monsters on show, then there is a rationale for having other character classes along for the ride who help the thieves and give the NPC band some diversity. Thus, clerics can be on hand to snake charm and speak with animals while mages could {@i charm monsters} or {@i speak with monsters} (if of high enough level; arguably a 12th-level mage has lots better to do than traipse around with a circus). Thieves with specialist skills such as acrobats, cat burglars, etc., will fit well into such a group."
												},
												"Players with any degree of gaming experience will have learned to keep well away from circuses. Old tricks such as having evil, high-level NPCs {@i polymorphed} into monsters or animals are well-known to such devotees of the game. So, it may be more enterprising to use some other group of entertainers, such as a traveling troupe of actors and musicians. They can perform the equivalent of passion plays, act and sing charming ethnic curiosities (especially elves), sing madrigals, and the like. A group of light-fingered expert thief choir elves could make for a lot of fun (they look so sweet and innocent, how could anyone suspect them?)."

They might well all call themselves guildmaster! Such a guild would have a very strong tendency towards chaotic alignments, and a nearly-equal tendency towards evil.",
										"Some type of organization and regularity would have to be imposed to make this a guild at all. Meetings half-yearly, with a quorum for votes and decisions to have any binding quality at all, would be a possibility. These could take place in the major piratical port, perhaps a town or city of unparalleled iniquity (what a place to send some PCs to track down the wicked pirates and stop their evil trade in pressganging/slavery/drug smuggling, etc.).

They will very rarely be Evil, and will also tend away from Chaotic alignment. For these reasons, they can become excellent mentors for a PC thief if this is appropriate to the campaign\u2014for example, a PC thief can come across one of them at work, or find evidence of the person's true identity as a renowned master thief."

										"This is a rarity. It has to be. Remember the Player's Handbook definition of a rogue; someone who feels \"that the world (and everyone in it) owes them a living.\" Thieves are \"the epitome of roguishness.\" Most thieves want to do as little work as possible and live as well as possible off the efforts of others. This is not exactly a definition of good alignment. The major problem with a good-aligned guild is simple: The large majority of thieves are not of good alignment. If a good-aligned guild comes into being (e.g., a good-aligned guildmaster comes to power) then many, if not most, thieves will actively seek a non-good (preferably neutral) guild if the guildmaster seeks to impose the values of good on them.",
										"What the intelligent good-aligned guildmaster will do is not to impose or accentuate the values of good within the guild. Rather, he will quietly squeeze evil thieves out, put them at risk, and try to make sure that evil activities (slavery, etc.) are downgraded or made to fail. Eliminating evil is much smarter than trying to establish good.",
										"However some good-aligned guilds can certainly exist in the campaign world. A classic example is the \"freedom fighter\" guild, a guild which stresses the values of chaotic good, in a Lawful Evil country or state. Such a guild will attract thieves of CG, NG, and CN alignments, and pure Neutrals will go along as usual. Even chaotic evil thieves might join, hating the repressive lawfulness of the state (especially if the guild rulers have the sense to play up Chaos and freedom in their pitch). Such a guild is one with the classic Robin Hood (robbin' hoods?) spirit. It could exist \"underground\" in an evil land such as the Scarlet Brotherhood lands (in Oerth) or Thay in the Forgotten Realms (FR6, Dreams of the Red Wizards), a secret urban organization with underground, hidden meeting-places and fearful helpers in high places\u2014a superb setting for intrigue. A rural equivalent, with scout-type thieves allied with tough rangers and others combining their skills to chip at the edges of a strong evil state, is another example, more suited to players who like lots of combat and tactical skirmish gaming than political intrigues and tense urban chases and the like.",
										"Other good-aligned guild possibilities exist, certainly, but require more careful thought by the DM. They are possible in a fractionated or oppositional guild structure, in a country where the good/evil division mirrors or parallels some other (e.g., good-aligned elves and predominantly evil-aligned humans), and possibly in super-goody-goody nations where they exist as security consultants and the like (but how do they accumulate their experience points for practicing their skills in earnest?)."

The half-elf's quick wits and skill soon brought him private training in magic from his doting mother, and he began adventuring early in life. The evils of the Pomarj, so close to Celene, offered ample opportunity for a mage to gain experience and prosper. But Septien's light-fingered talents found employment in the tolerant, liberal capital of Celene as well.",

It took the ravages of a broken love affair with a haughty grey elf ballerina to drive Septien first to drink and then to exile.

Found in the Kron Hills, bought by the Prince of Ulek and exhibited at the Gryrax Palace of Culture, the heavily-guarded diamond was irresistible. Septien brought off a daring robbery, and left a flower behind; the origins of his name. He privately sold the gem back to the Prince for 25,000 gp, a fraction of its value, later. Septien does not want riches. He does not steal for the wealth. He steals for the joy of being skilled and smart enough to get away with it.",

Septien was just putting his flower in place when the second thief arrived! The old guildmaster had just died, and to have the famous White Lily as guildmaster was a decision which unified the squabbling and divided membership and ruling council. Septien was drafted in, and somewhat regrets this. In truth, there is little burden on him, since the council makes all the day-to-day decisions and his freedom of action is little curtailed. But Septien regrets the day his identity was discovered. On the other hand, his increasing success as a musician (he is much in demand for concerts and as an accompanist) brings him good fees, public acclaim, and a steady rate of arrival of hopeful females at his secluded town house. There is word of his being made a Court Companion, the formal title given to an adviser to the Prince, who is thought to seek his views on elven and cultural affairs."

												"Tulmara Zir Bharann is Guildmaster of thieves in the city of Zazesspur, one of the \"Big Four\" cities of Tethyr in Faerun (see FR3, Empires of the Sands, for some further details on Zazesspur). She rules tyrannically over a large guild in this trade city, with some 140 thieves who are full-time members of the guild.",
												"Tulmara was born into opulence. The Bharann family is one of the older, more important ones in Zazesspur, and Tulmara received an extensive training in commerce and merchant life when young. Her naturally greedy and selfish temperament was exacerbated by being spoiled as an only child, and made more strident by this early coaching in personal greed. Her physical brutality, however, is something of an oddball characteristic, perhaps a throwback to her great-great-grandfather. Old Sulmair Bharann suffered fits of maniacal violence, but Tulmara's brutishness is more coldly controlled. Her gauntlets of ogre power aid her considerably in this respect; if she strikes or flails someone, they know they've been hit! Importantly, Tulmara has never picked a pocket in her life. Such vulgar street crime is beneath her.",
												"Soon after poisoning her parents to advance her inheritance, Tulmara began thieving. From her commercial work, she learned of the activities of other merchants, and began to plan and execute robberies of their premises. Expanding into blackmail and kidnapping, she was recruited into the thieves' guild by an early paramour, Arkail Rhassan. These two became rising stars in the guild, arranging for the old guildmaster to have an \"accident\" and then taking over the Guild themselves. The Guild prospered, and became wealthy; the junior thieves and apprentices, subjected to harsh discipline, could accept it if the rewards were good. And they were.",
												"Arkail was killed, murdered by an assassin; Tulmara has not been able to find out why (it was on the orders of the Shadow Thieves of Amn, who feared the rise of the Zazesspur Guild). Since this time, Tulmara has become more withdrawn and harsh, more cruel and evil, and more paranoid; the killing destroyed what little humanity remained in her. Now she strengthens the guild, and indulges herself in a few big heists, to pass the time; her heart is empty, her zest for life almost wholly gone. Her odd nickname in certain quarters\u2014\"Cruelty's Mask\"\u2014comes from a middling-rank guild member who knew of her cult sympathies (see below), contrasting them with the lifeless persona and deadpan facial expression of his Guildmaster.",
												"Tulmara is a devotee of Loviatar, and attends secret ceremonies and rituals of that faith. She rules her guild absolutely, and she rules it through fear. She respects only force and power in other people; intelligence, wisdom, and other gentler qualities are held for nothing. She has the force to back her cruel edicts, and while the Guild juniors suffer\u2014and no few flee the land\u2014the fear of her is so widespread that she stays in control of her guild, at least for the time being.",
												"In Zazesspur, there are some notable political intrigues involving royalists of various persuasion (see {@i Empires of the Sands}). Tulmara doesn't get involved in this; and allied with her guild's predominant preying on outsiders and foreigners, this has allowed the Zazesspur guild (and Tulmara) to grow strong and powerful without the authorities getting too fearful."

PCs might be terrorized by Tulmara's servants, hired to recover someone kidnapped by her, paid to act as bodyguards or couriers who are later attacked by thieves instructed by Tulmara, and the like. Tulmara strikes ruthlessly at those who thwart her, and since the scope of her operations is very wide, she can be thwarted in many ways!",
												"The key element is always to make PCs work hard to get closer to the identity of their nemesis. Tulmara's identity as guildmaster is known to few, and the familiar working up the ladder from apprentices or thugs, to middle-rank people, and then closing in on the heart of the operation should be the PCs' goal.

A permanent {@i stinking cloud} in a corridor leading direct to her personal chamber can be bypassed by her with the magical necklace she wears, but could be a problem for PCs!

With her armor class and her magical gauntlets, she is a fearsome fighter. Her escape routes (notably {@i oil of etherealness} and her magical cloak) are important, likewise her protections against certain attack forms (the {@i ring of free action} makes her immune to {@i hold} spells, the necklace of adaptation protects against gases, and so on). Tulmara often spies on people in the form of a bat, and the powerful webs she can cast from her cloak of the bat don't affect her ({@i ring of free action}). Tulmara has a fortune stashed away in various business premises, and can summon up a bunch of thugs to attack her enemies at very short notice, both guildmembers and hired mercenaries."

He keeps the magical items the guild possesses as a group, stocks of specialist thief equipment, and ledgers and accounts of the guild (membership dues and the like). These are all retained in his {@i bags of holding}. Marmel is not an expert fence, although he may use his Appraising proficiency to purchase and check items for the guild.",
												"Marmel began life as an apprentice to a Furyondian mage, and had to suffer ill-treatment as the mage developed an insidious form of insanity. His master refused to allow Marmel to make his own way in the world, but the unfortunate apprentice got his chance when the mage was forced to accompany a Furyondian naval foray against some of the declining piratical force of the Sea Princes. Their ship was sunk, and Marmel took the opportunity to kill his hateful and cruel master, grab a couple of travelling spell books with low-level spells, and levitate to safety. The pirates decided to capture him rather than shoot him down, their own flying mage bringing down the unhappy apprentice, and Marmel became a reluctant pirate.",
												"As piracy declined in the Sea Prince's lands, Marmel stayed with bad company in the form of thieves. His magic helped them, and they trained him. Marmel got safety and obscurity, staying in the guild house, in return for learning the skills of the thief. Marmel was very fearful that his old master might have been raised; his mage's guild might come looking for him; the old mage's relatives might come for him; in short, obscurity suited Marmel perfectly. It even overcame his fear of going robbing by night, and Marmel began an adventuring life anew as a thief, not wanting to work further as a mage, lest those he feared would be looking for a hapless young mage should find him and punish him for killing his master.",
												"Marmel is not now an active, adventuring thief. He is too valuable to the guild to be allowed to risk this. Happily, he has retired to a life of quartermastering. He maintains and administers the finances of the guild, and shepherds supplies and magical items for use by guild members. The availability of supplies is always good, due to Marmel's lines of supply and meticulous checks on his stocks. He also evaluates items brought in to the guild house by thieves, who must pay a 10% flat tithe of all earnings to the guild. Marmel's tripled Appraising proficiency makes him highly valuable in this respect. He routinely uses detect magic on anything which looks even remotely interesting. He can use an identify spell, and also has a wand of identification (duplicates the effects of an identify spell, with no Con loss to the mage) if several items turn up at once and the \"owner\" is in a hurry for any reason (he is reluctant to use his wand, since he can't recharge it, and charges 150 gp per charge for this service). If he is curious or suspicious about a guild member, or a seller to the guild, he will use investigative spells (or hypnotism) to learn more.",
												"Marmel is a gentle enough soul, rather other-worldly at times. He likes a spot of haggling, although it's almost impossible to get the better of him. He has a strange fondness for heraldry, and may purchase items with unusual heraldic design for himself. He has a modest fortune from his own thieving days, and is paid a good salary by the guild. He rarely leaves the guild house, and when he does it is in the guise of a merchant's clerk (often accompanied by a guildmember who has a cover identity as a merchant)."

Non-guildmembers can meet him for the sale or exchange of items, come across him at a sale of heraldic items, in an antique shop, or even possibly for training (for thief PCs)\u2014at a very steep price!",
												"A major role for any quartermaster is as a source of supplies. The DM can use a quartermaster to introduce new equipment items (the guild needs cash and the quartermaster is on a sales drive). \"Hot\" magic items (e.g., a sword with a non-erasable and unique design feature) can be sold to the quartermaster. New magic items could be had for sale (rarely), or exchange (more likely), or even borrowed for a security deposit. The DM should arrange these practicalities as he sees fit. You don't need tables of random determinations; you should use a quartermaster to bring in pet ideas, items you think are nifty, as you want to. Marmel has placed a {@i magic mouth} on each of his bags of holding, of course, so that if anyone other than him even touches them the magic mouth will scream out, \"Get your paws off!.\" Of course, maybe after all these years a relative of the Furyondian mage wants to know where the apprentice who killed his uncle (say) has gone with those spell books, and the PCs are hired to do the job.

												"Durdlan Silverpalm is a fence who works closely with the thieves' guild of Mirabar in the northwest of Faerun (see FR5, {@i The Savage Frontier}, for details). The guild here is small\u2014some 25-40 thieves at any given time will be in this large city\u2014but trade through Durdlan is brisk. Durdlan owns a couple of moneylender and pawnbroker shops, and lives in a small terraced house in a street of granite houses all occupied by dwarves (there are some 4,000 dwarves in Mirabar). His primary cover is as a moneylender, and his family has long been engaged in this trade, hence their surname. Other family members are moneylenders, pawnbrokers, and locksmiths, and Durdlan has a share in several of these, including his brother Glengar's famous Rig-A-Mortice locksmith's shop. Durdlan thus has a primary cover as a moneylending small businessman.",
												"Durdlan also has a secondary cover, a screen cover. He has been seen in disreputable company in Mirabar once too often in his 144 years, and the wily dwarf realizes that he cannot escape the scrutiny of the law all the time. So, Durdlan runs a small numbers racket (illegal and unlicensed gambling) betting on various events\u2014rat races (literally), ship sailing rates and arrival times and the like. The authorities thus know that Durdlan is a bad sort, but believe that he is just a small-time gambler and thus don't bother him much. Durdlan's screen cover (a petty crook to cover for his real big-time crook identity) works perfectly. The thieves Durdlan meets now and then in back alleys (seen by the agents of the authorities) also see the dwarf in the reinforced cellars of his home\u2014unseen by the authorities. There, they bring goods for sale and trade.",
												"Durdlan's primary specialty is gemstones and jewelry. Appraising such items, Durdlan is 95% likely to have an accurate estimate of their value. His secondary specialty is barbarian relics and icons\u2014items of antique nature, religious significance, or exceptional workmanship. With such items, from the Uthgardt barbarians of the north, Durdlan is 90% likely to estimate their value correctly. With all other items a standard Appraising test (Int+1, roll 16 or below) is made. When he is wrong, allow him an Int test. If this is made, he knows his estimate is uncertain and he will state a value some 50% of his original estimate. An incorrect estimate will be from 10-40% above the true value or 10-50% below it (perceived value= 50% of actual value, plus dice roll x10%. A roll of 0 is taken as zero).",
												"Durdlan offers a percentage of the true value of a hot item to his supplier. This is usually approximately 30-50%, depending on the \"hotness\" of the item, its absolute value (it is harder to sell very pricey items in many cases), the Charisma of the seller (no more than +4% for this), and the like. If the DM is very uncertain, simply offer 30+1d20%.",
												"Durdlan can dispose of hot property fast because he has connections with many merchant families in Mirabar who aren't too fussy about where their secret treasures come from. Indeed, the strongly competitive nature of these families means that they are often eager to have better relics and treasures than other families, or even to steal their rivals treasures and enjoy them in illicit secrecy. One of Durdlan's favorite memories is of selling a sapphire and emerald brooch from Evereska to five different families, for ever-increasing profit margins, within the space of a single year, as each family in turn commissioned thieves to steal the item from their neighbors. Durdlan made sure that when the brooch was secretly held by one family, the next rival along the social line got to hear of it.",
												"Durdlan has many friends in the dwarven merchant community who regularly dispatch wagon trains to Luskan on the coast. These caravans rarely get thoroughly searched; the guards have scruples which are alcohol\u2014soluble provided a few gold coins are put their way. This access to a major coastal port (where again the customs guards can easily be bought off) gives Durdlan the chance to sell his goods for export, where their identity as stolen goods will not be known.",
												"Durdlan is also ready, for a fat fee, to trade in human cargoes. That is, he will conceal people in his home (locking them into a cellar), and smuggle them out of Mirabar (usually in barrels or boxes bound for Luskan). Durdlan is believed to have helped one or two assassins in this way in his time."

He will try to stay invisible during a meeting if he can. He certainly doesn't like the location of his home being known.",
												"Durdlan is a fine fence to sell many items to, and he rarely attempts to swindle his customers. He is the person to see for a fast escape from the city. He is also a moneylender, of course, and can be encountered in that guise. His love of animals or bizarre fondness for ceramic halflings could also be exploited to bring him into contact with PCs (not necessarily as a fence).",

But Raimen swiftly flourished a polished bronze hemisphere topped with a cone, the open surface of the hemisphere wrapped about with a thin metal mesh. With only the hint of a flourish, he placed the end of the cone to his right ear and leaned closer to the door, gently placing the mesh-covered surface to the wood. A smile with just the slightest hint of smugness beamed from the older thief's face. \"Try again,\" Raimen urged his apprentice.

The use of lockpicks with the Open Locks skill is an obvious example. there are also many miscellaneous items which thieves are particularly likely to find useful in their work, and there is a full listing of these items also. A tabular summary of likely prices and encumbrance values can be found at the end of this chapter.",
						"All this isn't to say that only thieves should be allowed to use the items detailed here, of course. In some cases, other characters cannot use these items effectively. Lockpicks are useless for picking locks in the hands of anyone but a thief, for this skill is specifically (and exclusively) a thief skill. many other items do not necessarily have such restricted use. For example, the use of tar paper (see below for a full detailing of this) could potentially be useful for characters other than thieves. But such an item is particularly likely to be encountered in the subculture of thieves, and to be used by them when going about their nefarious activities. Also, taking a lively interest in equipment items which assist stealth, concealment, silent break-ins to places where you shouldn't be, and suchlike is naturally part of the role-playing of thieves. Brave, hardy warriors and pious priests really shouldn't be interested in such matters!",
						"In the full equipment listing below, it is entirely for the DM to determine whether certain items may or may not be available in the campaign world. For example, as noted in the {@i Player's Handbook}, combination locks may well not exist in a world based on medieval times, and thus the use of a small listening cone to assist in opening such locks would be irrelevant in such a game world.

The rope is simply affixed to the arrow, and when the arrow has found its mark the thief merely climbs directly up the rope. This method is simple, but the rope attached must be strong enough to bear the thief's weight, and this considerably reduces the effective range of the bow (and incurs penalties of -2 to hit and damage rolls if the arrow is used in combat for any reason). It also means that the bow shot, being less accurate and powerful, is less likely to provide a good purchase on the target.",
								"The second method is the two-rope method. Here, a light string is threaded through a loop attached to the arrow, and both ends of the string are kept by the thief. The string is light enough not to affect the flight of the arrow. When the arrow has struck the target, a stout rope is attached to one end of the string and the string pulled through to play out the rope, thread it through the loop, and extend it fully in place of the string. This method is obviously more time consuming than the one-rope method; it takes one round to play out 20 feet of rope in this manner. Twice the length of rope is needed, of course, since the rope goes from the thief to the target and back. this method is more likely to obtain a firm fixing of the arrow into the target.",

The blade of the knife is within a barrel inside the handle and is spring-loaded. The knife is triggered by pressing a catch on the handle; the blade shoots forward with considerable force. The weapon does the same damage as a normal dagger, although one point of damage is added for a first strike when the blade is triggered.",
								"The obvious advantage of the death knife is its capacity for surprise. Since it doesn't look like a weapon until the blade is sprung, a victim can be taken totally off guard by its use. If the target does not realize a blow is coming and the thief manages to get the weapon close to the body of the victim so that a lunge can be made with it, any strike is treated as a backstab, with standard hit and damage bonuses, given the surprise element. A backstab is not always literally a stab in the back!",
								"An envenomed death knife in the hands of a skilled assassin is an extremely dangerous weapon, and the DM may wish to rule that since the blade has to be concealed for some time before a strike there is a 25% (or higher) chance that the poison will have dripped from the blade before the assassin strikes with it."

Since administration of the poison/drug is rather haphazard here, the victim receives a bonus of +2 to any saving throw against its effects. Subtler and more refined designs have a needle capable of drawing up liquid from a reservoir, so that only a normal saving throw (or even one with a -2 penalty) applies.

The main use of the weapon, obviously, is the possibility of smuggling it into places where weapons are not permitted.",

Perhaps they have been hired to do away with that previous user. So, when they see it on the person of the PC...The history of the item can have great potential for adventure locked within it, which the DM doesn't need to exploit immediately. Also, the player whose character gets the item should not be told the history of the item; that's something he will have to find out for himself and, again, there may be adventures locked within this search. This is especially true if command words are needed to activate certain properties.",

If the poisoned character can be tended immediately (the round after the character is poisoned) and the care continues for the next five rounds, the victim gains a +2 to his saving throw (delay his saving throw until the last round of tending). No proficiency check is required, but the poisoned character must be tended to immediately (normally by sacrificing any other action by the proficient character) and cannot do anything himself. If the care and rest are interrupted, the poisoned character must immediately roll a normal saving throw for the poison. This result is unalterable by normal means (i.e., more healing doesn't help). Only characters with both healing and herbalism proficiencies can attempt the same treatment for poisons the victim has swallowed or touched (the character uses his healing to diagnose the poison and his herbalist knowledge to prepare a purgative.)",

If the herbalist needs to gather the materials as well (and there are materials around to be gathered\u2014not the case in most dungeons), at least half an hour is required to do so. When materials are available, putting together and administering an antidote takes 1d6+4 (5-10) minutes.",

If the check is successful, the antidote takes effect.",

The opponent is swiftly dispatched and Therius turns his attention to her wound. Orlene, meanwhile, has failed her saving throw. The DM knows that the poison is Type O, injected, with an onset time of 20 minutes; he notes this information secretly. One minute has already gone to finishing combat.

He rolls a 48 on percentile dice and fails. His next attempt is by sight, examining the slain opponent's blade, with a 20% chance of success. This also fails. Concerned about time (three minutes have already ticked by), Therius puts a dab on his tongue. He needs to roll 35 or lower...and gets a 26! He spits out the poison, recognizing it as type O. The DM doesn't bother to see if the poison affects Therius, since a paralytic poison at half strength would have no effect.",
								"Therius works to produce an antidote with the materials in his pouch. This takes him six minutes. He then makes a proficiency check, needing a 12 or lower (because herbalism has a -2 modifier\u2014see {@i Player's Handbook}, Chapter Five) for success. He rolls a 13\u2014failure! Nine minutes have ticked by. He hurriedly attempts again to concoct the antidote. This time it takes a full 10 minutes...Therius rolls a 9 this time, however, so he succeeds just in the nick of time.",

						"Terrak, the Master, looked through the hazy air of the hideout. The acrid scent of charcoal smoke mingled with the sweat dripping freely from his assembled thieves. Indeed, the air in the attic remained always fetid, for even on a cool night such as this they dared not open any passage to the outside. So precarious was their position in the city, so firm was the Black Duke's grip on the populace, that any hint of their presence here would bring swift and brutal reprisal.",
						"For the hundredth time, Terrak examined the members of his small band. They were brave men and women, and he trusted them all. They were bound to him not by any bonds of love\u2014though he knew they respected him\u2014but instead by a common, flaming hatred. He wondered, again, if such a ragged assemblage could actually be a threat to one as mighty as the Duke. But then he sighed, knowing they had no choice.",
						"Straight across from him, Terrak saw Ardina, the weaver. The old woman practiced her trade skillfully during the day, and none suspected that her bottles of dye, or her carefully wrapped bundles of cloth, were used to smuggle the gains of the band around the city, and even to locations beyond the high wall. Even now the band gathered in the attic of her shop, since she had risked her cover and her life to provide them this temporary hideout.",
						"Wistfully, Terrak remembered the guildhall, built with the profits of his long labors, and even the sweat of his own brow. The building had contained secret passages, hidden compartments, deadly traps, and easily defensible combat stations. But it had all gone up in smoke when the Black Duke's enforcers had attacked. Terrak's eyes misted as he thought of Serana, his beautiful, young Serana, calling to him with her last words before the flames had taken her, had taken so many of them.",
						"But the Master Thief hardened his mind and his plans. Indeed, it had been those same precautions, the secret doors and the hidden compartments, that had allowed this small remnant of his band to escape. Now they gathered here, dry kindling awaiting the spark that would ignite the flames of their revenge.",
						"Terrak turned to an old man beside him. \"And so, Rorden, the Duke's treasury awaits us now?\"",
						"The man nodded his balding head. Terrak reminded himself that the man was not as old as he looked. The Duke, however, had seized Rorden's wife for use as a concubine many years earlier. By threatening her with death, the ruler had forced the talented Rorden to keep his books and provide him with information. Now, the Duke's threat to claim the man's daughter for a similar fate had finally driven Rorden to fight against his brutal lord.",
						"\"Indeed, Master.\" Rorden spread a piece of parchment on the floor. \"You see here the layout of the Duke's mansion. I have marked the secret passage to the vault, though I could not gain the key to the lock. I am sorry, but the Duke keeps it on a key around his neck.\"",
						"Terrak waved away the man's apology. Once they found the lock, he knew Xeno could open it. Indeed, the lockpicker even now instinctively flexed his fingers and licked his lips. Xeno, too, had lost his woman in the Duke's raid. Terrak knew he would perform with skill on this night.",
						"\"And the painting?\" asked Terrak, carefully watching the other members of his band. He saw Rocko flex unconsciously, grasping the stump of his right arm with his left hand. Rocko had lost his hand as a mere boy, when the Duke's watchmen had caught him stealing bacon in the marketplace. Rocko was brave, but not terribly bright. He, of all of them, had expressed the most misgivings about the plan to steal the piece of art along with the Duke's treasury of gems.",
						"\"Remember, the Duke is ruled by his vanity above all else,\" Terrak reminded them, directing his measured stare at the unflinching Rocko. \"That painting of himself, the work he paid thousands of gold pieces for that it may hang in his great hall, serves as a symbol of his vanity. It has left a bitter taste in the mouths of the entire city. Its theft will put a large dent in the Duke's armor of rulership!\" (At least, I hope it will!), Terrak concluded silently.",
						"\"Now, the challenges,\" the Master Thief continued. He looked at Kyrin, to his left.",
						"\"I will have the wagon ready,\" the girl answered solemnly. She had been just old enough to understand her loss when her parents had died in the inferno of the guildhouse. Terrak knew that she spoke the truth.",
						"\"Here are the magic mouths.\" Terrak gestured at the parchment as Rorden nodded.",
						"\"My spell of silence will be ready,\" nodded another thief, a thin and wiry man of indeterminate age. Only the golden sheen of his blond hair suggested his true race. The half-elf was a skilled thief, but at times his talents as a magic-user were even more valuable to the band.",
						"\"These walls are oiled to prevent scaling,\" explained Rorden, gesturing around the periphery of the courtyard.",
						"A snicker came from a young woman across the room, and Terrak allowed himself a slight smile of his own. The Black Duke would need more than slippery walls to stop Bria the acrobat and her grappling hook. \"Just remember to drop a rope for the rest of us,\" reminded the Master.",
						"\"The family is now safe in hiding?\" asked Terrak, looking at the old weaverwoman.",
						"She nodded with a toothless grin. \"Puroch will join us now.\"",
						"Terrak looked again at his small, capable band. He knew them all, understood their strengths and their weaknesses. He would not betray them, and he knew they would not betray him.",
						"\"We cannot hope that the theft of a painting and a few gems will bring the power of this duke crashing down,\" he said softly. \"But if, by this theft, we can force the entire city to see him for the madman he is\u2014and his madness will be plain to all when he discovers the defaced painting hanging above the outer gate of his mansion!\u2014we can do him great harm.\"",
						"\"And too, we can pave the road to our return. Soon, my loyal comrades, we will become the influential guild that we were once before!\""

Savage tribesmen or aborigines, of course, have few possessions that a thief would deem worth stealing. While characters from these backgrounds might covet the possessions of other cultures, their methods of acquisition will be less subtle than those of a \"civilized\" thief.",

								"Rural cultures, too, will be less likely to provide interesting settings for thief adventures than will urban locales. Thief characters can of course learn their trades in small town or country settings, but unless they have a steady stream of travelers passing through from which to select their victims, such thieves will have difficulty maintaining a career of any long duration.",
								"But perhaps an even more significant cultural consideration is the view of that culture towards personal property and an honest day's labor. It is in this context that a city, with a strong class of merchants, an important economic system, and a reliance upon trade, becomes the ideal setting for the thief's activities.",

								"The answers to these questions determine, to a great extent, what kind of status a thief might hold in the society. Of course, status is almost always enhanced by wealth, but a wealthy thief, in many societies, is still regarded as mere scum, however cleansed and sanitized he may be on the surface.",
								"In areas where thieves are vigorously persecuted, thief characters will have to operate almost entirely underground. Even the location of such a major establishment of the thieves guild will be a carefully guarded secret. The guild headquarters might move around frequently, changing locations at the first hint of detection.",
								"Thieves in these types of societies will probably need to have several alternate hideouts lined up, ready for use at a moment's notice. The number of thieves working together, whether in a guild or a more informal band, will be small. Paranoia among the members will be common, and even the hint of betrayal will likely meet with gruesome consequences.",
								"Indeed, thieves in societies that strive to root them out will often be forced to resort to a cover occupation or identity, simply to maintain appearances with neighbors, casual acquaintances, and even curious members of the city watch. The development of the cover can involve as much time and detail as player and DM want to spend. In this type of culture, a thief's success at his cover can affect his fortunes every bit as much as his performance on the job.",
								"While a cover provides a thief character with an inherent professional weakness, it can also provide wonderful opportunities for roleplaying. Additionally, a thief who works to preserve a cover might find himself working in an area that is normally closed to thieves. This entails a corresponding increase in the likelihood of encountering lucrative targets for theft. Also, there will often be a relative lack of competition from other thieves in such an environment.",
								"Conversely, societies where thieves are at least tolerated, and those where thieves are accorded rank of some status, present thief player characters with other challenges. Because of the notoriously chaotic nature of the class, thieves are constantly adjusting the status of members within their ranks. Thieves who would succeed must struggle to stand out from the masses. Where every street has its cutpurses and every neighborhood its petty boss, the thief PC will find himself in the midst of savage competition. He will nearly always be forced to choose sides. Although this selection can include the choice of independent operations, of course, most thieves look upon those who are not declared friends as undeclared enemies. Competition from other thieves and thief organizations becomes a major conflict for these characters."

								"Obviously, NPCs are a major part of any social campaign environment. For a campaign with major roles for thieves, this must be one of the primary areas of DM concern.",
								"Details are important, as always. Because of the number of NPCs needed, DMs will probably want to develop a convenient shorthand procedure for keeping track of all these characters. It is not necessary, for example, to include stats and proficiencies and equipment for each shopowner and innkeeper in the player character orbit. Often a name for the character and a one or two word personality description will suffice to give the DM all he needs to roleplay the NPC in an interesting and consistent manner. (Remember, if the innkeeper is \"greedy and bigoted\" the first time the PCs encounter him, he is likely to be that way next time as well.)",
								"Of course, NPCs who might logically be expected to enter combat with the PCs (guards, rival thieves, thugs, bullies, etc.) will need to be detailed with the relevant combat information. Other NPCs who fill the roles of the potential targets for PC thievery (merchants, nobles, dandies, caravaners, fences, influential criminals and thieves, etc.) will need additional information on valuables possessed, how those goods are secured\u2014including notes on locks, traps, secret compartments, and the like\u2014as well as enough combat information to allow the DM to quickly adjudicate an encounter should matters come to blows.",
								"Chapter Twelve of the AD&DÂ® 2nd Edition DMG includes valuable information on defining the personalities of NPCs (pg.114) and on creating fast, realistic characters when needed (pgs.115-117).",
								"The DM, after working out an easy way of recording his NPCs, must then keep this information close at hand where it can be easily referenced. He is then ready for any encounters the characters might decide to find.",
								"A variety of NPCs is every bit as important as the detail used to record them. In all campaigns, the player characters will interact with folks from all walks of life\u2014in a thief campaign such interaction is common and expected.",
								"Some of the NPCs will need to be peers of the PCs\u2014fellow thieves and rogues inhabiting the same area. These NPCs can serve as rivals, temporary helpers, sources of information, and even sort of a measuring scale for the PC's successes.",
								"Thieves will often develop contacts with NPCs even lower in status than the thieves themselves. These characters can include beggars, urchins and orphans, harlots, and other low-life types. A stable of these NPCs can provide the PCs with a ready source of information (\"Here's a copper, kid\u2014go and count the guards outside the storehouse for me!\"), as well as providing a touch of believability to the campaign background. These low-life NPCs will, of course, have the same variety of personalities and abilities as other NPCs. Because the PCs represent persons of power to them, however, player character actions can have a great rebounding effect in their relations. For example, a thief that always shares a (however small) portion of his take with the gang of urchins constantly roaming the neighborhood will find those urchins to be useful lookouts and helpful, willing sources of information. The thief who spends his time cursing and kicking the youngsters away from his abode may just find them leading an elite unit of the city watch straight to his door.",
								"Potential targets for robbery include a whole vast realm of NPCs: wealthy merchants, powerful nobles, influential foreigners, even thieves and other adventurers who have enjoyed a certain amount of financial success in their endeavors. A variety of characters is essential here because this gives the PCs the opportunity to determine for themselves what will be the site of the next furtive operation.",
								"Here your group might try pacing the gaming sessions to give the players complete freedom of choice, while not burdening the DM with the task of detailing every mansion, noble house, and merchant shop in town. Simply use the expedient of closing a gaming session with the PC planning meeting for the next operation. Then, when the target for the theft has been selected, the DM has the next week (or next few hours, depending on how often you play) to prepare a detailed layout of the setting.",
								"No campaign is complete without at least one, or ideally several, strong villains to serve as antagonists for the player characters. Villains, of course, do not have to be criminals or other low-life types. They can be nobles, government officials, law enforcement officials or magistrates, foreign ambassadors, powerful wizards or sinister clerics\u2014in short, all types of characters can make good villains in a thief campaign. And don't overlook the grandmaster of the thieves guild or some other powerful criminal who might be a rival of the PCs; these kinds of long-running feuds can kindle the fires of many an extended campaign adventure.",
								"Whoever the DM picks as a central villain for the campaign, a few general principles apply. The villain must be a powerful character\u2014one who can inspire fear, or at least grudging respect, in the PCs. Power can be expressed in financial resources (an estate, fortress, collection of treasures, etc.), authority (such as a troop of guards or command of the city watch), personal abilities (such as magic powers, magical artifacts, combat skill and weaponry, or sheer intelligence or charisma), or, ideally, some combination of all these characteristics. Certainly in order to seem formidable, a villain's power must exceed the combined power of the PCs.",
								"Scenes involving the villain should be paced and staged carefully\u2014the PCs probably will not find him in a back alley rolling drunks. (If they do, that should tell them something about the drunk!) Villains, being powerful and influential individuals, are not stupid. When they are encountered, they will usually be surrounded by their lackeys and henchmen (some of these can be quite stupid, at the DM's option).",
								"In fact, the villain's lackeys should be common antagonists of the player characters throughout the campaign. It is well worth a DM's time to develop some of these henchmen as detailed NPCs\u2014minor villains in their own right. What is the Sheriff of Nottingham without his loyal house guards, after all?",
								"Any villain worth his black mustache will have one or two escape routes planned from every location where he is likely to be encountered. These will only be used in emergencies, of course, but can serve an important campaign function in that, as a villain escapes from near-certain death time after time, the players will develop their own motivation in wishing to go after him and end the conflict once and for all. This resolution, ideally occurring after many gaming sessions, then becomes a major triumph in the PCs' careers. Of course, if they blow it, the last battle can make a glorious final chapter in a PC career...",
								"A final category of NPCs, impossible to overlook in the thief campaign, are those characters entrusted with the enforcement of law, or justice, or power\u2014whatever prevails in your campaign environment. Even should you have created an anarchistic society, people will take steps to protect their belongings and some of these steps usually involve big, tough fighters.",
								"It is interesting and enjoyable to have several of these characters become very well-developed NPCs in the campaign. The gruff sergeant-major of the city watch, for example, might have a few stern words for the PCs each time they are apprehended. A villainous thug in charge of a platoon of mercenary guards might develop a personal grudge against the PCs that can grow into a major campaign storyline. Even a severe magistrate can be a recurring character, especially if PC lawbreakers are coerced into helping the forces of justice in exchange for their freedom, lives, or whatever.",
								"The DM need not go overboard on details for these NPCs. After all, having 100 NPCs in the campaign isn't much use if the DM has to shuffle 100 pieces of paper every time a player character asks a question. It is best to work out to your own satisfaction the level of detail required for consistent, enjoyable play, while allowing a brief enough format that the DM does not become overwhelmed with recordkeeping and NPC creation."

Are the grounds well-maintained? (Many a thief has failed a move silently check because the leaves rustled beneath his feet!)",
								"Add entertaining features to your buildings such as balconies, atriums, wide stairways with railings, chandeliers, swimming pools, secret passages, and so on. Hanging draperies can make wonderful emergency transportation, and a wine cellar, icehouse, or other specialized room can also be put to interesting use.",

However, if word of its theft has traveled far and wide, PC thieves might have difficulty getting someone to pay half the listed amount.",

By the same token, such an object might be recognized far and wide as stolen property\u2014a complication that can make disposal of the goods an adventure in its own right.",

								"Of course, establishing an artistic level of a culture is an ingredient of any campaign. Thieves, however, are more apt to become involved in the gaining and losing of such items than are characters of other classes, and because of this the thief campaign calls for a little extra attention to be paid here.",
								"Whether these objects are paintings, statues, jewelry or gemwork, tapestries or rugs, ornate crystal, or religious icons, a well-defined set of existing treasures helps a thief put his own acquisitions and losses into context. Dungeon Masters will find the time spent creating a detailed cultural and artistic background for the campaign well spent.",

Not every small strongbox in a city will have magical locks and a full-time patrol of high-level guards.",

Every social setting will have tension between the various legs of the power structure, whether these are ruling houses, political parties, or even different members of the same ruling family.",

The rich might seek to dominate the poorer folk, who strive in their own right to gain a share of the good life.

The conflict between a thieves' guild and independent (usually player character) thieves has become a cliche, but it still creates a tense background for a thief's activities. Just try to establish that this is not the only conflict around which the campaign is based.",

								"Like any good campaign, the level of magic in use is a function of the players' and DM's desires, the cultural setting, and perhaps to an extent the experience levels of the PCs. Much of this decision should be based on the magical capabilities of the PCs (whether or not the thieves have a wizard working with them, for example) and the degree of reward to be gained by overcoming magical challenges.",
								"In general, most challenges to thief PC missions should be found in forms the characters can cope with: mechanical traps instead of magical ones, for example, provide a better gaming obstacle to thieves.",
								"However, a DM can certainly employ magical traps to protect things he doesn't want the PCs to get their hands on. Also, such traps add an element of tension to a mission that helps keep everyone on their toes. A mission of thievery involving an intrusion into the lair of some powerful wizard should {@i always} have an air of magical, mysterious danger."

								"Thieves who can also perform the tasks of one or more other character classes also offer clear advantages when accompanying a mission. The fighter/thief, for example, will find many opportunities to wield his sword and perhaps a shield while his stealthy comrades go about their work.",
								"However, thief characters who also exhibit knowledge of another character class will sometimes undergo the scorn and mistrust of their more \"pure\" comrades. Very rarely will a thief/wizard or thief/cleric rise to a position of prominence in a thieves guild. Fighter/thieves are subject to less prejudice, perhaps because their abilities are clearly understandable to thieves. Fighter/thieves are nonetheless considered by most thieves to be of somewhat lower status than themselves."

								"Though thief characters often function as lone wolves, or in small, stealthy groups, they will often have need of the skills, or sometimes simply the reinforcing numbers, of others. Since thiefly activities generally flourish in urban environments, there is usually no shortage of NPCs for the characters to meet and use and henchmen or hirelings.",
								"Hirelings are particularly easy to come by, and can include craftsman and merchants as well as those of the adventuring classes.",
								"Hirelings, however, are not generally trusted with the knowledge of a guild or hideout. They will be contacted in their own place of residence or work, their information or services gained there, and then they will be left by the mysterious thief who disappears into the alleys and backstreets. Even when hirelings are used on a mission, they will often be joined at a rendezvous outside the guild, and left there when the mission is over.",
								"This is not a hard and fast rule, however. Particularly in cases where a guild location is well known, or where hirelings are necessary to the functioning of the guildÃ³there aren't enough PCs and henchmen to maintain a watch, for exampleÃ³a hireling will be brought into the lair. Of course, generally some effort will be expended describing to the hireling the consequences of his betraying the great amount of trust that has just been shown him. Indeed, in large thieves guilds it is unrealistic to assume that most members will be PCs or the henchmen of those PCs.",
								"Henchmen, of course, are another matter. They will generally be trusted to know almost everything the PC knows. As with any PC, some henchmen might be gained from the ranks of hirelings who have served loyally and bravely through the years.",
								"Ideally, however, the player and DM should give some thought to interesting backgrounds for other henchmen, based specifically on the player character's background. This is especially important if the character adventures in the same city or nation where he spent his childhood and youth. It is likely that {@i some} contacts would have been made during that periodÃ³contacts that now offer the potential of valuable help to the aggressive young thief.",
								"In the tangled world of the thief, such longrunning relationships are often the best way to develop a trustworthy companion. Players and DMs should combine to define a henchmen character drawn from a PC's background. Such a character should not be too powerful, but should be given a few useful abilities. If the henchmen is of an adventuring class, he should be of lower level than the player character."

								"Of course, the guildhouse is the most common type of thieves' den, but nearly all thieves will require some sort of secret lair from which to conduct their illicit activities. Dens and guildhouses will vary by size, in relationship to the number of thieves living or working there; and by obscurity, appropriate to the level of secrecy the guild needs to maintain in the community.",
								"Some societies expect thieves to flourish in their midst, and among these cities the guild will often be a large, perhaps even prominent building. Of course, it is not likely to have a sign posted, describing the building's nature, but a few discreet inquiries will usually allow one to discover the guildhall. Its location will certainly be known to the city watch or other law enforcers. Indeed, sometimes a watch captain or lord-mayor might allow a thieves guild to function in a known location simply to keep better tabs on it.",
								"But more often the guildhall's location will be a secret, guarded jealously and ruthlessly by the guild. Likewise, a den or hideout serving as a shelter for a small group of thieves will have a discreet and carefully protected location.",
								"Privacy can be found underground, of course. Subterranean thieves lairs offer the advantage that their presence is easily concealed from the outside world. However, many humans and demi-humans (excluding dwarves, of course) dislike the chilly, damp nature of underground living quarters. Thieves who risk their lives to gain objects of value are not likely to hide their wealth and themselves away in a hole in the ground.",
								"Additionally, the underground lair presents problems in construction. Large amounts of dirt must be hauled away, much labor is required in order to create a lair of any size. Both considerations add major difficulties to the secrecy of lair construction. A wizard with a {@i dig} spell, on the other hand, can make the excavation a whole lot easier, but doesn't solve the problem of dirt disposal.",
								"The easiest type of lair to set up is found in some already existing structure, or perhaps group of structures. A long row of town houses, for example, might be interconnected into a single, convoluted guildhouse. Or the attic of some merchant's shop can be taken by a small band to use as a hideout until they can get something better. Of course, if the merchant doesn't know about the thieves, chances of discovery increase dramatically. The best hideouts are buildings inhabited only by thieves, or by thieves and those who are in league with them.",
								"In some cities it will be necessary for the hideout to maintain some kind of cover. Perhaps it is enough that the neighbors think it abandoned. Maintaining this appearance requires diligence on the part of the thieves, however, for a pattern of noise or light detected from the \"abandoned\" house will be sure to arouse suspicions.",
								"If a cover is necessary, often a cooperative merchant or craftsman will labor in part of the house, maintaining the pretense of a place of business. Such a worker might even be a thief, but unless he can put forth a reasonable appearance of knowing his cover occupation, the craftsman and the hideout can both be in danger.",
								"Guildhouses and dens may also be maintained as private residences. Such locales are not so likely to be visited by strangers as are cover locations in places of business. However, the residents of the house will probably be known to the neighbors, at least by sight. Large numbers of strangers may give rise to suspicion.",
								"The hideout should ideally have several entrances, at least one of which is a block or two away from the actual den. A large guildhouse will have several such access points, usually connected via underground passages or secret corridors passing through surrounding buildings.",
								"Thus, in a secret guild, the number of people entering and leaving the hall will not be visible to neighbors or other observers. Indeed, if an access route is sufficiently torturous, a visitor can be brought into the guild without being shown the building's exact location. He might know nothing more than that the guild is within several blocks of a certain alley where he stepped through a secret trapdoor in the ground.",
								"A major guildhall will also have several built-in traps to deter unwelcome intruders. If enough thieves man the lair (more than a dozen or so), a full-time watch will be maintained.",
								"Only the most permanent of thieves' dens will have a built-in vault or storage chamber for the loot. When such a chamber exists it is only used for the temporary storage of objects that cannot quickly be fenced. Thieves know only to well that such storage sites are all too easily penetrated. It is much more likely that the thieves will maintain their hoard in some other, nearby but secret location. Of course, thieves who are very brazen about their activities, or very confident that they face no competition in a given locale, may well keep large amounts of valuables in their guildhall. Such a hoard might even be a source of pride to the guild, a sort of challenge to the unwary."
