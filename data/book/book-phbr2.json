				"Yet it is also a world of color and laughter, lively parties and bustling markets. The thief, more than any other character class, practices his arts among his fellow men (or halflings, or elves, or whatever). He seeks the gatherings of population, the confluence of wealth and avarice, where treasures are there for the taking.",
				"To be sure, many a thief has proven his worth time and again in the darkest reaches of a forgotten dungeon, among the snowy peaks of the bleakest of wild vistas, or within the halls of a fortress or military camp. Quests into the wild contain as much appeal for the thief as they do for other characters. In fact, should the prospect of treasure appear significant enough, many a thief will lead the way in encouraging his companions to embark on such a mission.",
				"But when the adventurers return to the sheltering walls of their homes, wherever these may be, and rejoin the population, the thief is best equipped to find adventure there. And when such adventure is discovered, it is thiefly skills that are most often called into play.",

If no guild is present, consistent information on other societal sanctions needs to be determined by the DM\u2014and the information must be available to players as well.",
						"Consequently, no portion of this book is prohibited to player viewing, nor is any part of it irrelevant to the activities of a good DM.",

And a few new rules cover areas of concern to thieves\u2014lethal and non-lethal poisons, for example, and how to determine the quality of workmanship used to build a lock or trap.",

						"{@i Sighing, Geraldor realized that any attempt to look like a gentleman was doomed to failure. He hoped his guildmaster's plan was intact.}",
						"{@i And there before him was the Highgate! Geraldor's heart pounded as he examined the brawny men at arms, four in number, manning the post. As the only public route into the city's Golden Quarter\u2014home of all the wealthiest merchants, most powerful lords, and influential ambassadors in all the land\u2014the Highgate was usually guarded well.}",
						"{@i But not tonight. Geraldor recognized the giant, hulking form of Morto, sergeant-at-arms of the city watch. As Geraldor had expected\u2014nay, hoped\u2014Morto commanded the detachment at the Highgate.}",
						"{@i With a barely concealed nod of recognition, Geraldor stalked to the gate and stood impatiently as Morto made a pretense of examining his \"pass.\" In reality, this crudely forged slip would fool no one with any capacity for comprehending script.}",
						"{@i But Morto's reading ability was not the issue tonight. Instead, the guard's loyalty to the guildmaster was the force behind Morto's curt nod and his gesture ushering Geraldor through the Highgate. Geraldor fairly skipped through the great stone arch. He had entered the Golden Quarter!}",
						"{@i Now his movements took on the shadowy aspect of the master thief at work. Though he remained alert, he knew that the major obstacle had been passed at the gate. The hefty bribes offered to Morto and his associates had paved the way to riches. It only remained for Geraldor to haul those riches away.}",
						"{@i The wiry thief found the mansion that had been selected by the guildmaster. Family and servants all slept, and they had no dog. In a matter of minutes Geraldor had collected the lady's gems. He spent several more minutes seeking the strongbox, finally discovering it in a small, luxurious sitting room. He picked the lock and pulled out only the most valuable coinage, platinum and gold, before soundlessly slipping toward the exit.}",
						"{@i In the house he saw magnificent silver candelabra, a huge and obviously enchanted sword, and other wonders. All of these he disdained as too bulky for his current mission. After all, Geraldor was a professional!}",
						"{@i Scarcely suppressing an urge to whistle, Geraldor sauntered back along the Golden Way. He would pass through the Highgate again and immediately disappear into the clustered neighborhoods that crowded both banks of the muddy river.}",
						"{@i He saw Morto at the guardpost and nodded casually, passing under the great stone arch again on his way out of the Golden Quarter. Only then did he notice something wrong: Morto stood mute, with his hands shackled before him.}",
						"{@i At that same instant a heavy gauntlet fell upon Geraldor's shoulder and a massive arm propelled him into the stone wall of the gatehouse.}",
						"{@i \"What have we here?\" growled an unfamiliar voice. Terrified, Geraldor saw that it issued from beneath the shiny cap of a watch captain.}",
						"{@i \"J-just going home, m-my lord!\" he stammered, wriggling in a futile attempt to break away.}",
						"{@i The captain laughed, having already found and discarded Geraldor's fake pass. The man's gloved hands continued to poke through Geraldor's clothes and pouches, retrieving object after object, often with a low chuckle.}",
						"{@i \"The lady Allorana's diadem, I see\u2014perhaps she loaned it to you!\" The captain roared with hilarity, joined by the guffaws of a full company of guardsmen that Geraldor now saw in the shadows.}",
						"{@i Then the captain's voice lowered as his hand tightened around Geraldor's throat. \"Now, thief, you will find out what the laws are in our town. And you will have time to learn them while you rot in gaol!\"}",
						"From even before the time, thousands of years ago, when the Code of Hammurabi first defined the legal system of a body of government, and extending to the present day, societies have created procedures for defining personal possessions. An inherent part of this definition includes the penalties due those who violate these procedures. Odd as it may sound, thieves cannot exist without some kind of legal framework.",
						"And from the time in any culture when personal possessions come into being, there have been those who seek to remove the possessions of others and make them their own. It is for players of characters who attempt this perilous exchange of wealth, and to their Dungeon Masters, that this tome is intended.",
						"Of course, some thievery occurs under the guise of authority, and as such falls beyond the scope of this book. Tax collectors, for example, may steal from those who regard such claims as thievery. So do conquerors. But these are not AD&D® thieves. While they may approach the category of bandits, their \"theft\" demands more fighting skill and aggression than stealth.",
						"By far the more common type of thievery, and the one that generally comes to mind when discussing the character type, is the furtive pilfering described in the incident above. Poor Geraldor has suffered the fate known to many of these wrongdoers as he is taken by the long arm of the law. But if that law did not exist, then Geraldor's task would become meaningless.",
						"This point is one that should be well remembered by those who play thieves as well as those who run the campaigns. Regardless of how chaotic the setting, a structure at least vaguely approximating a legal system is necessary before the thief can really begin to ply his trade."

He is often aloof from other, \"lesser\" thieves: He has little tolerance for flamboyant fools, like the Artist and Trickster; Desperadoes and Kleptomaniacs, desperate and obsessed, are sloppy and crude in comparison to his refined talents and balanced temperament; Folk Heroes are just silly. The Vigilante is a dangerous foe for the Professional, in part because he is incomprehensible to him. The Mobster would seem to be the Professional's kindred spirit, but they are too tightly bound (in the Professional's opinion) by honor and family loyalty and such trash. The Professional is bound to no absolute codes, except perhaps a contract and a clean, efficient theft. He has honor and honesty inasmuch as it is necessary to maintain his reputation for dependability.",
								"The Professional's motivation is hard to pinpoint. Clearly it is neither justice nor loyalty; and he knows that greed, whim and the lust for fame can cloud judgement and lead to fatal sloppiness. Perhaps then \"survival\" would be the best description of the Professional's motive; though any Professional worth his salt does better than merely survive. Of all the archetypes, he is perhaps most likely to have a businesslike, middle-class background, though any of the others is possible. The Professional is usually based in a city, or wanders, and his services are usually for hire. He may be associated with a guild, but would prefer to be as independent as possible\u2014other people's involvement in his work is more often hindrance than help."

Ironically, the Vigilante trains himself in the very skills of the thieves he opposes; he comes to know their ways and their minds as though he were one of them.",

This is especially true in the case of locales where the leadership is a bit on the shady side itself, perhaps riddled with bribery, graft, connections with crime, and other such corruption. The Vigilante leads a dangerous life, for he can have many powerful enemies.",

Popularity might do little to ward off a powerful thieves' guild, but it can cow the more fearful of public officials into tacit approval of his extralegal exploits.",

This particularly happens in large cities, where there may be ghettoes of demihumans, or where thieves' guilds have purposely raised demihumans in their midst to take advantage of their races' special abilities and benefits, while suppressing natural and cultural inclinations (dwarven honor, halfling peacefulness, half-elven wanderlust, and so on).",

The professional is not contemptuous of his victims; they simply failed to protect their property adequately, and suffered the economic consequences.",

A few transgression may be overlooked by the criminal community, but a pattern of consistent disregard for the code will cause a character's reputation to deteriorate.

He is not immune from dishonorable thieves, who may try to burn him or squeal on him; but he will have the support and approval of others in exacting revenge on those who wrong him. Also, if he is captured and imprisoned by authorities, he can expect the privilege of the fix; the guild contacts (or less formal contacts) may arrange his release through bribes or favors.

						"Most thieves go through a period of training and apprenticeship, as do legitimate tradesmen. They are taught by an established, experienced thief, who was taught by a thief before him. This goes back untold generations, to the earliest thieves who developed skills on their own and then shared them with partners and apprentices. Over the years the skills and techniques have been formalized and perfected, especially under the normalizing influence of the large and powerful guilds that have arisen.",
						"But not every thief is molded in this way. There are always others, known as \"lone wolves,\" who developed outside the \"system\" of the established underworld. They discovered and developed their larcenous abilities without the aid of a mentor.",
						"Many lone wolves resemble normal thieves so closely that they may be treated as the very same thing, as far as class, abilities and restrictions go.",
						"However, in some cases a lone wolf may turn out very different—perhaps different enough to be considered a class unto himself. To design such a character, you may use the optional rules, \"Creating a New Class,\" in Chapter Three of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}.",
						"The emphasis of such a character should still be on thieve's skills, but it may be that not all of the traditional skills are present. And the character may have other unusual abilities as well, cultivated to assist in his roguish endeavors.",
						"Imagine, for instance, a self-taught pickpocket. He may have Pick Pockets, Move Silently and Hide in Shadows, and perhaps Climb Walls (to help get himself over fences or whatever when he is pursued by an observant and angry victim). But he could have no other thief skills; for his thieving lifestyle there was no need for them.",
						"Note how this would be different from a traditional thief specialized in pickpocketing (as in, for example, the cutpurse kit): Even though he specializes in the course of his career, the cutpurse received a core training that included all the thief traditional skills—a liberal arts education in larceny, if you will.",
						"Lone wolves often lead dangerous lives. They must be very self-reliant, and they have to find their own contacts for scoping out jobs and fencing stolen goods. As \"freelancers\" they run a constant and most serious risk of running afoul of monopolistic thieves' guilds.",
						"Guilds are often wary of lone wolves, who are more likely than \"established\" thieves, with trusted contacts and reliable references, to be spies for authorities or rival guilds. The lone wolf is also regarded by guildsmen with a mix of curiosity and contempt—and sometimes even admiration, if his odd mix of abilities proves particularly useful \"in the field.\"",
						"A lone wolf, as we said, may be a character class unto himself. Most such classes never have more than one member, and when he dies his unique combination of skills is forgotten; the class ceases to be. On rare occasion a lone wolf may take an apprentice or two, and the class may be perpetuated in this manner. (If you are using the 1st edition AD&D® game, you may suppose that the Assassin class arose in this manner.)",
						"Guilds who have accepted lone wolves into their ranks may ask the thief to take on apprentices—but two things usually prevent this: One, conservative guildmembers typically see the lone wolf's unorthodox methods as a threat (because they are not understood), or as inferior to the traditional way of doing things; and two, lone wolves, used to doing things by themselves, are reluctant to share their secrets.

										"Ajathar was originally apprenticed to an illusionist. He never completed his formal training, however. His master, Zalabom the Magnificent, was outspoken on a number of religious and political issues. One day his words went too far against the popular grain, and a mob dragged him from his tower, stoned him to death, and set fire to the building after looting it. Young Ajathar narrowly escaped with his life and a couple of texts of illusion magic.",
										"Homeless and hungry, Ajathar had to steal for a living. Assisted by what few illusions he could muster, he became a burglar—and a surprisingly proficient one, considering that he was self-taught. As his burglary skills improved, so did his understanding of the magical arts of deception.",
										"He took as his symbol, his trademark to be left at each \"job,\" an illusionary blue hand. The illusion would fade after a few days—but its discovery came to invariably bring panic to the heart of anyone who discovered it in his house. Sometimes Ajathar would not take a thing, but only leave the hand as a warning, a taunt, a mockery of a house's easily-penetrated defenses.",
										"Eventually Ajathar moved on. His native town, where Zalabom was killed, was neither affluent nor an exciting place for a daring young entrepreneur. \"Bluehand\" may therefore be found anywhere that the DM should wish to relocate him.",
										"One peculiarity of Ajathar's character is his strict adherence to the alignment of True Neutrality. The lesson he gained from Zalabom's death is that extremism and fanaticism in any form are dangerous and to be avoided. Both the illusionist and the bloodthirsty crowd are, to Ajathar's mind in hindsight, repulsive. Any apprentice that Bluehand might train would have to be True Neutral as well.",

								"This is going to be answered in heaps of useful detail in this section. But it's useful to have a basic working idea to start with. A thieves' guild is a grouping of thieves who agree to work together, in at least some ways. Often because of external threat and danger, it makes better sense for them to cooperate a little. This group typically has a leader—a guildmaster—or maybe a small ruling council. It has laws by which members must abide; there can be many of these, or few. A guild will usually only exist in a reasonably-sized town or city, where there is enough work for thieves. It will usually also have a central meeting-place, almost always secret; this is usually referred to as the guild house. Finally, it's also usually true that the large majority of these thieves are not of good alignment—they tend towards neutrality at least, if not towards actual evil."

								"This chapter sets out to understand first what benefits a PC thief will derive from membership in a thieves' guild, and what responsibilities and duties he will have in return. This is a good place to start, for two reasons. First, it briefs the DM on luring the PC into guild membership so that instead of being onerous, it becomes interesting and rewarding. Dragooning a PC thief into guild membership isn't as good as the lure of the carrot (with the threat of the stick in the background...). Second, in looking at the \"rights and responsibilities\" guild members have, many of the functions of the thieves' guild—its raisons d'etre—become clear in the process. This helps to show why such guilds exist.",
								"This matter—what thieves' guilds do—is developed further in the next major section. The activities of the guild are divided into core functions—what almost all guilds will do—and secondary ones. Secondary functions may be carried out or wholly avoided, depending on the guild in question. These various activities are laid out for the DM here to make guild-designing easier later on. Players may also get ideas for sneaky and nefarious behaviors for their PCs here. Many \"secondary functions\" will relate to the specialized thief kits presented earlier. This section does not make explicit use of these kits, since different DMs will wish to handle these differently. However, developing specialist NPCs to fulfill these specialized activities is greatly facilitated by using the kits.",
								"Next, the relation of a thieves' guild with other groups is considered. These can vary from minimal to very highly organized indeed. The DM is briefed on major associations (with merchants, the law, other guilds) and the general social background to thief activities.",
								"Immediately before the section on designing guilds, there is the crucial issue of the power at the top of the guild. This is usually the Guildmaster—or maybe a small group of dominant thieves, a ruling council. The personalities involved here will have a major effect on the personality of the guild, and need careful design by the DM.",
								"An extensive design section, complete with play-aid record sheets, is then provided to enable the DM to develop a thieves' guild for the major urban setting(s) in his campaign. This section uses a flexible approach to guild design. That is, there are tables which can be used for random determination of aspects of guilds, and dice-rolling alone will generate workable guild structures. However, the DM is encouraged to use a guided-semirandom approach, tailoring or omitting certain dice rolls and choosing design options which produce the most suitable and pleasing overall picture. This also covers the possibility that there is no formal thieves' guild, with design options for very loose affiliations or even relative anarchy!",
								"An example, the thieves' guild of Mallain, shows how to use the design system. This example takes an apparently contradictory set of dice rolls, and shows how to resolve them; the result is that the intrigues and tensions in the resulting Guild structure can be a focus for adventures for any PCs. The Guild becomes far more than just an anonymous body a thief PC pays dues to!",
								"A short section on unusual thieves' guilds (travellers on the road and others such) is followed by a valuable DM resource, a section on handling PC Guildmasters. The straightforward system laid out here handles guild income, hassles, arrests, trials and tribulations, followers arriving and leaving, morale, and the day-to-day business of running a thieves' guild. This should make life a lot easier for the DM!",
								"A small number of selected \"blueprint profiles\" for major NPCs within a guild follow; the DM can use these unchanged in game play or modify them as he wishes."

								"\"What do I get out of it?\" is a reasonable enough query from a player with a PC thief when told his character must join a guild, or if it is strongly suggested as a wise option by the DM. By answering the question, many of the functions of the thieves' guild which benefit its members become clear. Below are detailed the most common benefits gained, although these will vary from guild to guild, with an example of one additional benefit typical only of membership in a certain kind of guild—a highly organized and resourceful one!",
								"It is not the case that every guild will provide all the benefits listed below, but certainly almost all guilds will provide training, access to necessary equipment, and the like.",
								{
									"type": "entries",
									"name": "Training",
									"page": 51,
									"entries": [
										"The {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} gives training (to gain experience levels) as an option for DMs. There is much to recommend training as a necessity for level gains. Having a PC train with a master, mentor, or tutor—probably with others of his profession around—allows many, many things to happen naturally without their obviously being spoonfed by the DM. Rumors and news can be caught up on. Hints and tips (e.g., concerning the usefulness of some of the new equipment items reviewed elsewhere) can be exchanged. New friends and contacts can be made. Intrigues and scams can be plotted, gossiped about, and initiated; employment can be offered; schisms and factions within the guild can become a focus for adventuring. All this is just for starters. Training is a natural way for the DM to enrich the game in all sorts of ways.",
										"Second, while certain skill gains can be seen as the result of practice, this does not apply to all the advances experience brings. New weapon and nonweapon proficiencies are the most obvious example. How can a thief who has never used a short sword, for example (because he has not previously been proficient with it), suddenly develop a proficiency in its use without training? This is obviously wholly unrealistic. How can a thief learn an Etiquette proficiency, enabling him to pull scams on the rich and haughty more easily, without a tutor to coach him in upper-crust, high society ways? He sure can't learn Etiquette from a dungeon crawl or wilderness hike! Likewise, if the player chooses to pile most of the 30 ``skill points'' gained for a level into one or two skills only, the PC could well need a specialist tutor to coach him in these skills—a good way to bring in one or two of the specialist thief kits as NPCs, too.",
										"So, training is an important element of the game, and the thieves' guild is the place where the PC thief will have the best chance of finding a tutor to train him. He may have to wait a week or two, or maybe a little longer if the DM wishes this, but by and large the guild will go to some lengths to make tutors available."

But where does the thief get lockpicks, tiger's claws, razor rings, silenced armor, and suchlike? From the thieves' guild, of course.",
										"In addition to being a source of equipment for sale (and possibly even for loan), here is an obvious chance for role-playing possibilities.

										"This is an often-overlooked aspect of the thieves' guild. A PC thief may steal all kinds of things which he hasn't any idea about, so far as their price goes. He didn't find the hidden safe in the merchant's house, so out he comes with a bag containing a jade statuette of a cat (actually imitation jade so it's mostly worthless), a crystal vase (exceptional elfin work, worth a fair sum), a crude wooden idol (an antique, and thus worth far more than the thief thinks), and more...Indeed, in the absence of any special nonweapon proficiencies (such as Gem-cutting and the like) the thief may often have little idea how much nonmonetary treasures he has stolen are worth. Even with the Appraising proficiency, the thief's estimates may often be wrong, and a fair proportion of items too unusual or singular for the thief to be sure anyway. This is one area where the fence can help the thief.",
										"A resourceful thieves' guild will have members who can accurately value different sorts of items, and will also have contacts with certain specialists who aren't actually thieves but who also aren't terribly ethical either. They can handle real rarities. The Fence thief kit gives a basic design option for fences, and the blueprint profile section (later in this chapter) also details a highly experienced and versatile fence who can be used straight off the page (as it were) or developed by the DM for use in his campaign.",
										"A special case is that of magical treasure. A simple {@i {@spell detect magic|PHB}} spell from a mage-thief specialist in the guild, working with the fence, can tell a thief that the nice gold signet ring he filched from the drunk fighter is a magic item, worth far, far more than its value as gold. The same NPC can tell the thief (from an {@i {@spell identify|PHB}} spell) that the ring is a {@i {@item ring of protection|DMG +2}}, worth thousands. This only needs a 1st-level magic-user with the fence, but it's a priceless service for the thief!",
										"The other role for the fence, obviously, is that the thief gets \"hot\" property off his hands quickly. It will probably be out of town very fast, to be sold in some distant location where its illicit nature will not be suspected. Obviously, fences never pay more than a fraction of the market price for goods; but a fraction may still be a fair sum, and the thief runs no risk of being apprehended."

Multi-class thieves are also important people for many jobs—a mage-thief with such spells as {@i {@spell invisibility|PHB}, {@spell levitate|PHB},} and {@i {@spell knock|PHB}} (to consider but second-level spells) is of obvious value. Having one accompany a thief on a robbery increases the chances for success considerably, but even if this isn't possible, a simple {@i {@spell invisibility|PHB}} spell precast on the hopeful robber gives an important edge for sneaking past guards and the like.",
										"Then again, other adventurers might be called upon. Depending on the guild's relations with other bodies, a cleric (with {@i {@spell find traps|PHB}}, among other spells) would be a most useful accomplice for many tasks. If the DM's campaign world has a deity which is an obvious patron for thieves (such as Olidammara of Oerth, or Mask of the Forgotten Realms), clerics of such a deity might well have very cordial relations with a thieves' guild. This is considered in more detail below.",
										"The guild can thus act as a clearing-house, with names and meeting places to assist a PC thief hoping to pull a job but needing help. Again, whether these contacts actually agree to help will depend on many things—notably the reputation of the PC thief! However, the fact that they are there at all can be helpful for the PC thief, possibly for his friends as well, and can be very useful indeed if the thief PC wants to pull some job away from the rest of his usual adventuring group, when he must have some such extra help for success.",
										"Of course, a thief may simply need the assistance of others of his own kind for some job he has planned. This may be a simple decoy person to help with pickpocketing in the streets, or an eagle-eyed lookout for a warehouse job. Either way, the guildhouse may be a better bet than hanging around dubious taverns and hostelries. The flipside of this, of course, is that an impoverished PC can hang around the guildhouse touting for offers of work himself!",
										"Finally, a well-organized guild will even be able to help its members if they get into serious difficulties. A jailer may be bribed, a magistrate bribed or blackmailed, a man of law paid to plead the thief's case in the courts (if the judge or magistrate cannot be bribed). If the captured thief is very senior in the Guild, even a commando-style \"liberation\" may be possible! Such actions will leave the thief indebted to his guild for some time to come...",
										"So, these are the main functions of the thieves' guild, as far as a PC thief entering the guild can see them. There are certainly other things the guild will do, and we'll look at them in due course. Before that, let's look at the other side of the coin—the responsibilities the thief has to the guild. For all the advantages, what does the guildmember have to pay one way or another?"

Many guilds will insist that such major crimes can only be committed with the guildmaster's permission. This is especially likely to be true with a strong guild, and in a lawful or repressive society where such actions may stir up a hornet's nest of trouble for the guild.",
										"Feeding back general information to the guild will also keep a thief in good standing with his fellows. A thief casing a joint for a later break-in might see an unusual number of guards around in the courtyard of an adjacent building as some crates are being taken inside from a wagon, and one crate splits slightly at the top revealing the glint of gold or ivory in the bright sun...The thief knows that he cannot organize a robbery over there as well as in the place he's casing already, so he reports the pleasant view to the guild. Doing so will certainly keep the thief in good favor. The thief will be expected to provide such information should he come across it, but the guildmaster might well reward particularly helpful guild members, mark them for promotion, give them a sinecure role in some other guild job, pay a small percentage of the guild take to the helpful informant, and the like.",

This is obviously going to be easiest if the identities of the snitches are actually commonly known within the guild—how can you not poach a snitch if you don't know who is one, after all? But, because some thieves may be very nervous about this, the identity of certain really important snitches may be kept secret. The guild will protect them by warning thieves away from the key snitches indirectly (e.g., with an edict that no one is to try to \"make friends\" with the staff of such-and-such an establishment).

But territorial restrictions may be just as important.",
										"The simplest form of this is that certain thieves will have their \"own patch\". Pickpockets are the most clear-cut example. A notably busy thoroughfare, one where merchants and (especially) foreigners throng, is a patch which a skilled group of pickpockets will fight determinedly to keep as their own, exclusive territory. Protection rackets are another obvious case of a demarcated territory where other guild members do not stick their noses in.

Exceptions are allowed only after careful consideration by the leader(s) of this group. This situation may happen if a guildmaster is weak and the second-rankers start carving out territory for themselves, but it might arise for simple reasons of historical accident (in a walled city with major internal divisions, gates between town quarters, and so on—the City of Greyhawk is an example). At its most extreme, a city might in effect (if not in name) have several thieves' guilds, each controlling one section or quarter of the city, with the boss of each splinter faction meeting with the others at regular times to try to co-ordinate efforts and defuse tensions."

Also, the traditional meaning of the term \"protection racket\"—\"pay up or we break your legs\"—is not exactly what is implied here, although thieves denied payment by a merchant might resort to the threat of violence to drive away the merchant's customers, staff, and the like.

Fit and able-bodied people, their senses undulled by illness or drink, can pose as beggars for a better living (in a rich city) than they can make by honest means (e.g., as farm laborers). Such people would make excellent spies. A Guild of Beggars is by no means unlikely in many city settings. And, since children make very appealing beggars as they look soulfully up from their sad little eyes and beg for a penny for a poor orphan, such a guild will find and train such rapscallions. The more talented (dexterous and/or intelligent) ones may well be sold on to the thieves' guild, for a consideration, to become apprentice thieves."

However, this does not mean that the guildmaster is a tyrant, nor that he is cruel or even necessarily strong (a weak despot is in real trouble, however). It means that the guildmaster thinks that he knows best, and this doesn't imply wickedness or cruelty. The guildmaster may be very intelligent, wise, and far-seeing. Also, just because the guildmaster is a despot doesn't mean that the guildmembers don't like this state of affairs—a truly smart guildmaster will gain the loyalty of the guildmembers through his wisdom and the way his rulings clearly benefit the guild.",

He is ready to listen to advice, and may delegate some of his authority and decision-making to others within the guild. Again, this need not necessarily make the guildmaster popular. A common problem for a populist guildmaster is that he will be perceived as weak, especially if the affairs of the guild are not in good order. He may leave himself wide open to backstabbing (quite literally).",

Combining these should be fairly straightforward for the DM, but the developed case of The Thieves' Guild of Mallain (page 76) gives an example of how to combine these different elements into an overall picture for a guildmaster's style of leadership."
