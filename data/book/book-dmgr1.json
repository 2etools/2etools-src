Players and OMs are attracted to the mystery and intrigue created when characters enter the murky world of the quest for power. Players seldom know who they can trust or which side is the right side. When faced with an army, the choices are easy. When faced with diplomats and politicians grappling for more power, the choices are more difficult."

Pace of play is an intangible sort of thing that partakes of the speed, variety, intensity, and continuity of game play in an adventure. Speed refers to how fast the action in a game takes place. Variety suggests a selection of play styles and encounters, including combat, puzzle solving, and roleplay. Intensity has to do with the level of suspense the DM has created in the game—from a peaceful or even silly \"none at all\" level to the \"nail biting fear and frenzy\" often associated with movies where undefeatable alien monsters eat everyone but the heroine and the kid.

Like a runner, a DM needs to conserve enough energy (both emotional and physical) to make the last halfhour of game playas enjoyable as the first. Games without end arerarely enjoyable by all parties involved. As the ending time draws near, the DM needs to watch for an obvious stopping point (again, interludes and cliff-hangers are best). As a warning though, the OM who sets up a cliff-hanger ending for his game session will find hilTIself under immediate pressure to resolve the situation. Everyone wants to know what happens next. It is better to quit while the players are still interested and excited, than to continue gaming past reasonable endurance."

These flexible playing surfaces are marked off in either hexes or square grids. The one-inch size are the most popular for fantasy gaming. Washable overhead projector pens are used to draw the encounter areas in a scale appropriate to the miniatures (where an inch usually equals five feet). Some mats are even transparent so that the DM's predrawn maps can be placed under them allowing the map grid to provide the necessary scale.

In fact, even if the character knows that the item is magical, he will not be aware of its precise abilities until they are used. Yet, once the players think that they have a magical item, they begin to dig into their rule books to rapidly narrow down the possibilities of what they have found.

Whatever method is used, limit it in some way so that it will not be too difficult to handle in the future.",

Thus, this weapon is a well known object now which will instantly be recognized by others as magical in nature. Such descriptions are a good way to add to the feel of a game.",

For example, if the characters manage to find, borrow or steal the personalized wand of a high-level sorceress, any attempt to use the wand might produce random results.",

Marvelous things bring out the child in us. When magical beasts make an appearance, scare the characters or make them marvel in wonder.",
								"Have the monsters or NPCs make startling or mysterious entrances and exits. A wizard or monster appearing in a puff of smoke may be a trite and overworked cliché, but that's the general idea. Try having thieves who sneak up to politely tap a character on the shoulder, or monsters who drop from the ceiling or leap from hidden cavities in the floor. Have the lights go out and when they are rekindled, the monster/NPC has appeared or disappeared (hey, it works in detective movies). Use the old \"chill wind shivering the spine\" effect to make an encounter seem weird. Leave the players wondering \"How'd he do that?\"",
								"Use foreshadowing to warn or hint of an encounter's eventual occurrence. Foreshadowing is a storytelling technique where mysterious minor events seem to tell of the occurrence of another major event. For example, a dream might hint at black shadows creeping across the countryside, implying something evil this way comes. A found note might reveal the name and intentions of an evil wizard 'who's actions have recently involved the PCs. The idea is to give the players just enough infomation to make them wary or nervous, then slowly play up the fears through other hints and rumors until they crave/dread the foreshadowed encounter.

These fantastical game worlds have been mapped, populated and imbued with life by the designers, writers, artists, and editors involved in their creation. They are rich in details and good examples of what campaigns can develop into. Still, most DMs get the urge to create worlds of their own, making fantastic realms based on their own fertile imaginations.",
						"For the determined DM, a challenging task lies ahead. Campaign creation is fun, often even more challenging and exciting than actually playing, but it's also work-time-consuming work. For both the novice and experienced DM alike, the time required to create a new, original game world can be daunting. The thought of spending endless hours building a world from scratch may seem overwhelming. There is a lot of work involved, but it need not all be done at once. Start small and work upward and outward from the core of ideas upon which the campaign is based. Don't do more work than is initially required to give the players a taste of the world in which they live. The wise DM will never put more work into a campaign than he can reasonably get back in play value and neither must he do all the work himself.",
						"The DMs first step is to get organized. Have a folder ready for notes about the campaign world. Three-ring, loose-leaf binders are a good way to keep your notes in one handy place. Don't mix unrelated information. Use index dividers to keep related notes together. Even if the sewers beneath the city are the place where the PCs will adventure, keep those \"dungeon\" notes separate from the city descriptions.",
						"Next, think about the general nature of the world and focus on the locale in which the characters will adventure. Will it be a land of warring medieval baronies, a remote and rugged wilderness, an arid desert realm, or a sophisticated oriental empire? The DM may wish to base the world around a favorite fantasy novel or even historical Earth. Whatever the desired feel, the DM should keep his plan in mind when developing pieces of the world.",
						"Third, divide the work of creating the world into easy-to-handle stages. Don't try to do it all at once. Start small. Write ideas down as they come and leave room for them to grow. Not everything need be in place before the first game session, just enough to give a bit of local flavor, or a sense of position limited area, called a core area, need be described. Beginning player characters need not know much more.",
						"Consider starting in a remote part of the world, close enough to civilization to be settled by humans, but far enough away to be of little immediate concern to the lords of the land. A village or even a friendly wayside inn provides a base of operations for the characters, a place for them to rest, recover from adventures and spend treasure gained during encounters. A road or two should go somewhere, though the locals may only know that it goes to the next village. If the village has a temple or a shrine attended by a cleric (who is willing to heal wounds), determine which deity the cleric serves.",
						"Build outward from the core area. Before the second play session the DM should map out major terrain features for several days' journey around the characters' base of operations and have a large-scale map of the land in which the adventures take place, including the positions and names of major cities and landmarks."

						"Asking the DM to even attempt to handle every aspect of game world creation is similar to asking the architect of a major construction project to do the plumbing and wiring himself. Chances are he can do it sooner or later, but meanwhile, the building goes unfinished. In a like manner, the DM can take forever and try to cover every detail of his world himself, but why do it? Why not involve the players? Let them do some of the work of creating cultures, religions, and area maps for parts of the world. Great idea, but how?",
						"Let the players come from parts of the world other than where the campaign will initially take place. If a player wants to play a seafaring barbarian, give him a coastal or island area from which his people originate. Give him a peek at what has been roughed out for that area. Encourage the player to make notes about what goes on in his comer of the world. Much of this can come from his character background. Who are his people's gods? Do they have any peculiar customs? What are the major cities? Encourage the player to draw the regional maps for his homeland. The more the player details his character's culture and homeland, the more he designs that portion of the DMs world.",
						"In a similar manner, the players of priests and paladins can expand upon the nature of gods and religions in the DM's world. Thief characters may be both the basis for a thieves' guild and an overview of the laws of the land (particularly as they relate to larceny).",
						"Now this doesn't mean that everything that the player says has to be law. In fact, the creative DM will take what the player gives him, and modify it ever so slightly to reflect what the DM knows to be true of his world (things the player's character wouldn't or couldn't know). Does it matter that the player knows what part of the   world map looks like? Not particularly. It is his character's homeland.",
						"Listen to the players. Although much of the core design and development falls on the DM's shoulders, don't design the world without listening to the players. What do they want to do? What kind of adventures do they seek? What interests them? Design the core area and the first adventure to meet these desires. It would be folly to design a campaign around political intrigue or a grand mystery when what the players really want are monster hunts and dungeon crawls. As the players become involved in the DM's world, the DM can rely upon them for inspiration."

				"To choose to be a Dungeon Master is to accept the responsibility of creating fun, challenging adventures for eager players and their characters, and developing a larger setting in which their adventures are to take place. This setting must be one that takes on life, developing and growing on its own. This eventually takes the fonn of a unique fantasy world, which takes shape with lands, legends, and peoples drawn from the DM's fertile imagination. While it's possible to run a campaign entirely within the confines of someone else's pre-made world, such as the DRAGONLANCE® campaign lands of Krynn or in the vast reaches of the FORGOTTEN REALMS™ campaign setting, there is no greater glory for a DM than to run adventure campaigns set in his own world.",

In this section, we will examine life underground and give you, the dungeon master, a few interesting insights on the evils lurking there.",
