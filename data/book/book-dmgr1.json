                "The dungeon master's task is not an easy one. On his shoulders rests the responsibility for the whole game. It is the DM's job to make sure that everyone, himself included, has a good time when they play the AD&D game. If you are an experienced DM then you are sure to know that there are times when this task is so daunting that you wonder why you didn't stick with a safe hobby like stamp collecting.",

                "In the second section we'll offer advice on how to pace the events of your games, set up campaign worlds, make better game maps, and reduce the amount of time you must spend to make ready for a game. In addition, we've included a section on making NPCs more realistic and important in your campaign.",
                "Thirdly, we've included chapters about what it is that sets a dungeon based campaign apart from a wilderness campaign. Here, you'll find tips on making the most out of those gloomy passages that run beneath the surface of even the most pacific nation.",
                "To close out the book, we present a number of maps for use by referee's when time is tight. Unlike the tradition \"hole in the ground\" dungeon, however, each of these is somewhat\u2014unusual."
