Players and OMs are attracted to the mystery and intrigue created when characters enter the murky world of the quest for power. Players seldom know who they can trust or which side is the right side. When faced with an army, the choices are easy. When faced with diplomats and politicians grappling for more power, the choices are more difficult."

Pace of play is an intangible sort of thing that partakes of the speed, variety, intensity, and continuity of game play in an adventure. Speed refers to how fast the action in a game takes place. Variety suggests a selection of play styles and encounters, including combat, puzzle solving, and roleplay. Intensity has to do with the level of suspense the DM has created in the game—from a peaceful or even silly \"none at all\" level to the \"nail biting fear and frenzy\" often associated with movies where undefeatable alien monsters eat everyone but the heroine and the kid.

Like a runner, a DM needs to conserve enough energy (both emotional and physical) to make the last halfhour of game playas enjoyable as the first. Games without end arerarely enjoyable by all parties involved. As the ending time draws near, the DM needs to watch for an obvious stopping point (again, interludes and cliff-hangers are best). As a warning though, the OM who sets up a cliff-hanger ending for his game session will find hilTIself under immediate pressure to resolve the situation. Everyone wants to know what happens next. It is better to quit while the players are still interested and excited, than to continue gaming past reasonable endurance."

These flexible playing surfaces are marked off in either hexes or square grids. The one-inch size are the most popular for fantasy gaming. Washable overhead projector pens are used to draw the encounter areas in a scale appropriate to the miniatures (where an inch usually equals five feet). Some mats are even transparent so that the DM's predrawn maps can be placed under them allowing the map grid to provide the necessary scale.

In fact, even if the character knows that the item is magical, he will not be aware of its precise abilities until they are used. Yet, once the players think that they have a magical item, they begin to dig into their rule books to rapidly narrow down the possibilities of what they have found.

Whatever method is used, limit it in some way so that it will not be too difficult to handle in the future.",

Thus, this weapon is a well known object now which will instantly be recognized by others as magical in nature. Such descriptions are a good way to add to the feel of a game.",

For example, if the characters manage to find, borrow or steal the personalized wand of a high-level sorceress, any attempt to use the wand might produce random results.",

Marvelous things bring out the child in us. When magical beasts make an appearance, scare the characters or make them marvel in wonder.",
								"Have the monsters or NPCs make startling or mysterious entrances and exits. A wizard or monster appearing in a puff of smoke may be a trite and overworked cliché, but that's the general idea. Try having thieves who sneak up to politely tap a character on the shoulder, or monsters who drop from the ceiling or leap from hidden cavities in the floor. Have the lights go out and when they are rekindled, the monster/NPC has appeared or disappeared (hey, it works in detective movies). Use the old \"chill wind shivering the spine\" effect to make an encounter seem weird. Leave the players wondering \"How'd he do that?\"",
								"Use foreshadowing to warn or hint of an encounter's eventual occurrence. Foreshadowing is a storytelling technique where mysterious minor events seem to tell of the occurrence of another major event. For example, a dream might hint at black shadows creeping across the countryside, implying something evil this way comes. A found note might reveal the name and intentions of an evil wizard 'who's actions have recently involved the PCs. The idea is to give the players just enough infomation to make them wary or nervous, then slowly play up the fears through other hints and rumors until they crave/dread the foreshadowed encounter.

These fantastical game worlds have been mapped, populated and imbued with life by the designers, writers, artists, and editors involved in their creation. They are rich in details and good examples of what campaigns can develop into. Still, most DMs get the urge to create worlds of their own, making fantastic realms based on their own fertile imaginations.",
						"For the determined DM, a challenging task lies ahead. Campaign creation is fun, often even more challenging and exciting than actually playing, but it's also work-time-consuming work. For both the novice and experienced DM alike, the time required to create a new, original game world can be daunting. The thought of spending endless hours building a world from scratch may seem overwhelming. There is a lot of work involved, but it need not all be done at once. Start small and work upward and outward from the core of ideas upon which the campaign is based. Don't do more work than is initially required to give the players a taste of the world in which they live. The wise DM will never put more work into a campaign than he can reasonably get back in play value and neither must he do all the work himself.",
						"The DMs first step is to get organized. Have a folder ready for notes about the campaign world. Three-ring, loose-leaf binders are a good way to keep your notes in one handy place. Don't mix unrelated information. Use index dividers to keep related notes together. Even if the sewers beneath the city are the place where the PCs will adventure, keep those \"dungeon\" notes separate from the city descriptions.",
						"Next, think about the general nature of the world and focus on the locale in which the characters will adventure. Will it be a land of warring medieval baronies, a remote and rugged wilderness, an arid desert realm, or a sophisticated oriental empire? The DM may wish to base the world around a favorite fantasy novel or even historical Earth. Whatever the desired feel, the DM should keep his plan in mind when developing pieces of the world.",
						"Third, divide the work of creating the world into easy-to-handle stages. Don't try to do it all at once. Start small. Write ideas down as they come and leave room for them to grow. Not everything need be in place before the first game session, just enough to give a bit of local flavor, or a sense of position limited area, called a core area, need be described. Beginning player characters need not know much more.",
						"Consider starting in a remote part of the world, close enough to civilization to be settled by humans, but far enough away to be of little immediate concern to the lords of the land. A village or even a friendly wayside inn provides a base of operations for the characters, a place for them to rest, recover from adventures and spend treasure gained during encounters. A road or two should go somewhere, though the locals may only know that it goes to the next village. If the village has a temple or a shrine attended by a cleric (who is willing to heal wounds), determine which deity the cleric serves.",
						"Build outward from the core area. Before the second play session the DM should map out major terrain features for several days' journey around the characters' base of operations and have a large-scale map of the land in which the adventures take place, including the positions and names of major cities and landmarks."

						"Asking the DM to even attempt to handle every aspect of game world creation is similar to asking the architect of a major construction project to do the plumbing and wiring himself. Chances are he can do it sooner or later, but meanwhile, the building goes unfinished. In a like manner, the DM can take forever and try to cover every detail of his world himself, but why do it? Why not involve the players? Let them do some of the work of creating cultures, religions, and area maps for parts of the world. Great idea, but how?",
						"Let the players come from parts of the world other than where the campaign will initially take place. If a player wants to play a seafaring barbarian, give him a coastal or island area from which his people originate. Give him a peek at what has been roughed out for that area. Encourage the player to make notes about what goes on in his comer of the world. Much of this can come from his character background. Who are his people's gods? Do they have any peculiar customs? What are the major cities? Encourage the player to draw the regional maps for his homeland. The more the player details his character's culture and homeland, the more he designs that portion of the DMs world.",
						"In a similar manner, the players of priests and paladins can expand upon the nature of gods and religions in the DM's world. Thief characters may be both the basis for a thieves' guild and an overview of the laws of the land (particularly as they relate to larceny).",
						"Now this doesn't mean that everything that the player says has to be law. In fact, the creative DM will take what the player gives him, and modify it ever so slightly to reflect what the DM knows to be true of his world (things the player's character wouldn't or couldn't know). Does it matter that the player knows what part of the   world map looks like? Not particularly. It is his character's homeland.",
						"Listen to the players. Although much of the core design and development falls on the DM's shoulders, don't design the world without listening to the players. What do they want to do? What kind of adventures do they seek? What interests them? Design the core area and the first adventure to meet these desires. It would be folly to design a campaign around political intrigue or a grand mystery when what the players really want are monster hunts and dungeon crawls. As the players become involved in the DM's world, the DM can rely upon them for inspiration."

Otherwise, use a convenient unit of measurement, such as an inch, to mark distances on the map. The chapter on map making gives more detail on maps and map scale. For our sample continent map, we will assume that the DM is using a blank sheet of paper with a scale of 50 miles to the half inch. Thus, on a standard 8'/2 by 11 inch sheet of paper we can map an area 850 miles by 1,100 miles—just under one million square miles!",

The best way to start a cultural synthesis is to research cultures from our own history. Find several that are intriguing and that would apply to the world being created. The cultures involved need not even be historical contemporaries. The typical stereotype of hard working, staid, metal-mining dwarves might be combined with the fanatical Mujadheen rebels of Afghanistan to create fiercely driven, semi-nomadic dwarven rebels, fighting against an occupying force, and wielding weapons of superior construction and design. Merge Oriental martial artists with medieval Europe for a people whose knights fight only with unarmed combat. Make sure that the most important aspects of the synthesized cultures are logical. An Egyptianized barbarian culture may mummify their dead, but they would not have the skills to make enduring pyramids.",

To make a people truly memorable, search for an answer along fantasy lines. The non-bathers may fear evil water spirits or believe that dirt upon their bodies helps them draw magical power from the world. The draconian artists might focus on actually becoming dragons as their faith increases.",

Consider any peculiar customs that may have developed, like the practice of showing an open palm or shaking hands to indicate that they are free of weapons. Behavioural oddities can make a culture appear more exotic than a few oddities of appearance.",

At the other extreme, is the DM who roughly sketches out the relationship between encounter areas, shows corridors as lines and makes up other details as he goes along.

Dungeon Masters should keep this in mind when using normal graph paper. When using graph paper, the expression \"one square = five feet\" means that the measurement along the side of the square corresponds to a full-scale measurement of five feet. Such a map square would cover an area of 25 square feet.",

If the DM feels equal to the task, a style of mapping called perspective mapping can provide more drama and clarity to the DM't's maps. Perspective mapping has advantages and disadvantages compared to standard orthographic (top view) mapping. On the positive side, a perspective map conveys the three-dimensional nature of a setting much more realistically than an orthographic map. The position of each dungeon, castle or cavern level relative to all other levels is much clearer, and the connections between the levels are easier to see.",

A land with dragons is not a theme, whereas dragons who like to prey on villagers is. Other examples include: Ores mass for invasion in the mountains, a migration of barbarians threatens the kingdom, or rats threaten the villagers. The theme must provide a need for character involvement and then be sufficiently broad to support several adventures. Taking the example of the barbarian migration, the players first hear of burnt villages on the frontiers from refugees which leads to a series of adventures, all based on different scenarios, but linked together by the theme of the migration.",

They are encountered during the course of an adventure and may range from shedu to shop keepers, trolls to trollops, and korred to kings.",

						"In a sense, NPC creation is a part of both world and adventure design. NPCs exist in the DM's world in much the same manner as a city, a castle, or a dungeon. Theoretically speaking, the DM has placed them in his world to fulfill a specific purpose, such as running the dry goods store, owning the tavern, ruling the land, and so on. Chances are that the DM has even given these folks names and decided whether they are young or old, male or female. But beyond that, there is either nothing or a generic stereotypical personality.",
						"Unless the DM has unlimited time available, he will want to restrict the amount of detail he creates for each of the NPCs in his world. It would be nice to know each stable boy, shop keeper, or monster as individuals; to know their fears, desires and personality quirks, and, when necessary, roleplay them as exciting characters. The truth of the matter is that defining characters as personalities takes time. Therefore personalities are developed only as much as will be needed to make good game play.",
						"What determines the right amount of development? The answer lies in the NPC's importance to the DM's world and to the plot lines of his adventures. Greater importance means greater development. Just as in the movies, not every part is a speaking part. Some characters just stand around to fill out the crowd scenes-they remain both nameless and faceless. Others exist only to fight the player characters. Time spent developing such characters will be time wasted.",
						"However, if the PCs will spend any time in conversation with an NPC, such as the local tavern keeper, a bandit chieftain, or a favorite informant, the DM will want to personalize that character, give him an interesting appearance, unusual speech patterns and a personality quirk or two. Unless the NPC is to be a key part of an adventure, his background and motivations are irrelevant to the game. Once the DM has rounded out the character as described before, he has enough ammo for role-playing without worrying about fulfilling the character's inner needs.",
						"Yet when an adventure revolves around an NPC or if an NPC must play an important part in the lives of the player characters, such as becoming a patron or a henchman, then that NPC deserves the full treatment. The DM should take the time to fill out every aspect of the character's background, appearance, possessions and personality."

								"For example, if the PCs encounter a stable boy who is important to the DM's adventure, he could be just another nondescript person who tends horses for a living, or be a boy, 15 years of age, orphaned when was young, taken in by a farmer and raised in an environment where food was scarce and beatings plentiful. In fact, one of the beatings could have damaged his hearing so that he yells out \"ey?\" whenever someone speaks to him. He has a particular fondness for horses and will immediately befriend anyone with a similar interest, or viciously turn on anyone he sees mistreating a horse. His lifetime dream may be to have his own stable some day, and marry Eliza, the cobbler's daughter (which is a near impossibility, as she has been secretly betrothed since birth to an ogress's son in order to lift a curse on the cobbler's wife).",

In the AD&D game world, however, flying creatures or warriors pose an ongoing threat to security. The walls of even the most powerful concentric castle will be of little or no use in stopping the fiery breath of a red dragon as it races overhead. Brave warriors who stand ready on the battlements will suddenly find themselves exposed to attack with only their own armor for protection",
								"An underground fortification, however, is shielded from such aerial bombardments. If built under a traditional castle, it provides the defenders of the structure with a place to withdraw to in the event of a catastrophic failure of their surface defenses. In short, the added expense and time required to equip a castle with an underground section may be well worth it if it means holding out against an airborne foe who might otherwise overwhelm your defenses."

The net result is that fewer defenders are required to keep an area secure. On the other hand if you choose to maintain the same number of defenders, you can greatly increase their effectiveness. Underground fortifications require a would-be attacker to expend far more troops in any attempt to overrun a defending force.",

The tactics employed ranged from undermining (a slow, but effective process of removing the earth that supports a wall and using explosives to bring it down) to storming (an all out assault on the defenders).",
								"In attempting to tackle an underground complex, nearly all of the traditional tactics and weapons fail utterly or are, at least, reduced to minimal effectiveness. Rams, while they might allow you to break through a gate on the surface, leave you faced with the problem of charging headlong into a well defended, and possibly trapped, corridor to reach the fortress beyond. Catapults and siege towers, while excellent at overcoming high stone walls, are utterly useless against underground complexes.- Storming an underground structure requires that you attempt to fight your way into it through the few, heavily defended, entrances; an action certain to cost you dearly in troops. And mining, which is still effective as a means of gaining entry into a dungeon, simply creates another entrance which, after the initial surprise has worn off, can be as well defended as any of the others."

Of course, the mine may still have exploitable ores in it or untapped veins which are just begging to be found by adventurers. If this is the case, the original owner of a mine is more than likely to pop up again and demand his fair (or unfair) share of the take.",

								"There are numerous types of caverns and cave complexes created by nature without the aid of living things. These are found around the world, in a variety of environments, and provide easily available housing to any number of intelligent and unintelligent races. Many creatures, like the piercer, have evolved in this type of an environment and are utterly helpless outside of it.",
								"Limestone Caverns are one of the more common types of natural dungeon complexes which adventurers will encounter. Limestone caverns are found in areas where the bedrock is composed of limestone, dolomite, or marble, and where there is abundant groundwater or rainfall.",
								"The formation of a limestone cavern is easy enough to understand. Limestone is a very soft type of rock which is easily eroded and altered by running water. In addition, rain water (which is more acidic than ground water) can rapidly break down areas of limestone which it comes into contact with. Over the course of centuries, the ongoing action of the local water supply simply carves its way into the heart of the bedrock.",
								"Limestone caverns are often difficult to explore, having narrow passages, steep inclines, and areas which have been blocked by cave ins. Entrance to such complexes can often be gained through the inlets which have been carved by running water (often a tight fit) or by descending into a large chamber whose ceiling has collapsed to create a sinkhole in the surface above it.",
								"Over a period of time, the water which formed a limestone cavern may dry up as the climate changes. In such cases it is not uncommon to find small streams, springs, and pools within caves which are in otherwise dry regions of the world. In addition to underground pools, streams, and rivers, limestone caverns are noted for numerous other distinctive features, most of which are formed, in one way or another, by the action of natural water.",
								"Stalactites and stalagmites, the most well known type of formation, are conical pillars of mineral deposits formed by dripping water. As the water evaporates, it leaves behind foreign matter which has dissolved in it. As the centuries pass, these traces add up to form large projections. The color of these features is dependent wholly on the type of minerals which compose them, but can range from gray to brown or even to red or white in unusual cases.",
								"Other features common to a limestone caverns include draperies, flowstone, and the rare, but fabulous, gypsum flowers. Draperies are formed when a sheet of running water evaporates, leaving behind a rock formation that resembles a ruffled curtain. Flow-stone is a formation which has the appearance of a terraced stream of oozing sludge. The last, and most beautiful of these formations, is the gypsum flower. Delicate and crystalline, these rare structures give every cave explorer pause to wonder at the elegance of nature's handiwork.",
								"Sea Caves are another common form of natural cavern complex. Sea caves are found in coastal regions where the action of the pounding surf has broken away sections of a cliff face. As a rule, sea caves are much smaller than limestone caverns since the energy of the surf which forms them dissipates rapidly as the cavern grows.",
								"It is not uncommon for sea caves to be partially filled with salt water as the ocean actually reaches right into them. In fact, more than one adventurer has been caught and drowned in a sea cave when the coming of high tide brought water surging into the cave, flooding it completely. As a rule, however, tidal surges come on gradually enough for the typical explorer to anticipate them and leave the sea cave before being placed in any great danger.",
								"Unlike limestone caverns, sea caves are not marked with any great natural formations. In fact, they are very smooth and often seem almost artificial in their construction. The reason for this is simple enough, the repeated crashing of the surf and tidal action of the sea has worn down the rough surface of the rocks in the cave and prevents any unusual rock formations from evolving.",
								"Lava Caves are, perhaps, the most unusual type of cavern found by the average explorer. Located only in regions of current or past volcanic activity, lava caves are created by the flowing and cooling of magma which rises up from deep within the earth. Because of the unusual way in which they are formed, many lava caves are completely cut off from the surface world. They will be discovered only by a deliberate excavation to search for such chambers or by an accident which breaks into them.",
								"As a rule, lava caves will not have the unusual features associated with limestone caverns, but will more closely resemble the smooth interiors of sea caves. This is due to the fact that the lava which forms the cave in the first place is molten and tends to settle and cool without forming sharp edges or large outcroppings. In fact, one of the more common features in a lava cave is the \"tube\", which is formed when the outside of a stream of magma cools into a shell and forms a pipeline for the lava within it. In many cases, long sections of the tube will end up empty, creating a smooth passage which is very circular in shape.",
								"Faulting is a process which, while it does not create whole cave complexes, can open up some very large chambers in the earth's crust. Faulting is caused when one section of rock breaks away from another. Caverns fanned in this manner can be quite large, but seldom have any other chambers or tunnels associated with them (unless they have been expanded by artificial means).",
								"Cavities of this nature make good camp sites for a band of travelers, but also serve as comfortable homes for many varieties of monsters and animals."

								"The examples presented above are intended to provide a dungeon master who is planning to run an underground campaign with a variety of settings which will be more or less familiar to the players. One drawback to such dungeons, however, is that they can become trite. After all, characters who spend most of their time in sea caves and limestone caverns will probably long for a change of scenery from time to time. The following section is meant to provide a referee with some ideas for a change of pace.",
								"The basic premise which we have followed so far assumes that a dungeon complex is formed either by man, nature, or animals as an underground structure. But what happens if we take a building which was intended to stand on the surface, and then tum it into a dungeon? Here are a number of ways in which otherwise normal buildings can be converted into subterranean complexes just begging to be explored by adventurers.",
								"{@b Sand Storms:} In the myths and legends of many cultures dwelling near or amid the sands of a great desert, there are tales of mighty sandstorms. In regions of the world where the desert is particularly prone to such tempests whole cities have been known to vanish from the face of the earth.",
								"The cultures in and around the Sahara Desert in North Africa are filled with stories of cities \"swallowed up\" by the blowing sands.",
								"{@b Silting:} On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have silting. In order to have a dungeon created by silting, a region must be flooded by rising waters and left submerged for an extended period of time. As the years pass, sediment carried in the water begins to collect around the structures and, eventually, they will be completely covered by mud and debris. Then, as the climate changes or is altered, the water recedes or is drawn away. If enough time has passed, the silt covered buildings will look like nothing more than mounds of earth. Anyone who takes the time to dig a little deeper, however, will learn the truth.",
								"{@b Volcanism:} Volcanism is a wonderful tool for transforming above ground structures into underground dungeons. Perhaps the mightiest natural force known to man, a volcanic eruption can send sheets of lava boiling across a region, instantly covering it in rock as it cools. In addition to lava, of course, volcanoes are known to unleash rivers of mud which, when it dries, can also encase cities or villages in stone or hard earth. Even volcanic ash, powdered stone created by the mighty living mountain, can entomb whole cities. Over the years, it too will harden into stone.",
								"Perhaps the most well known example of volcanic entombment is the buried city of Pompeii.",
								"{@b Overgrowing:} Far less dramatic than volcanism, overgrowing is a natural process found in many parts of the world. It takes place when a building or village. in a heavy forest or jungle region is abandoned by its owners for some reason. Over the years, the jungle vines and plants, which were kept at bay only by the actions of the inhabitants, return to the area. In a fairly short period of time, the jungle may become so thick that it is almost impossible to pass through it. Dungeons formed in this manner are still above the surface of the earth, but are so cloaked in vegetation as to be unreachable by all but a few means. Once inside a structure which has been overgrown, adventurers will find themselves able to exit only by those few openings which remain in the foliage around the building.",
								"Examples of overgrown structures in our own history which might make superb dungeons are the Aztec and Mayan cities found in South and Central America.",
								"{@b Magic:} Of course, the thing which makes the AD&D® game world more than just a history lesson IS the introduction of magic into an otherwise fairly common medieval setting. Just as magic can make many common things wondrous, so too can it make ordinary settings into exciting dungeons to test the metal of your bravest knights and most pious priests.",
								"Powerful magicks can be used to create dungeons of unusual nature or serve to guard them with unnatural defenders. Of course, the magical powers of priests and druids should not be discounted here. Consider, for example, the section on overgrown jungles above and then imagine a druid's hand in the background. What was once a simple patch of brambles might grow into a deadly labyrinth guarding some ancient druidic secret.",
								"{@b Above Ground Dungeons:} While this may seem to be a contradiction in terms to the novice referee or player, it is not. In our own history there are numerous structures which make excellent dungeon settings just as they are. For example, we don't need magic or volcanic eruptions to tum the Great Pyramids of Egypt into dungeons. The myriad tunnels and chambers built within these ancient structures are as challenging to explore as any underground complex.",
								"There are other examples from our own history which might be classed as dungeons. The pueblo cities of many American Indian tribes might make good dungeons, as would any number of monasteries or similar structures built for isolation."

At least, not anyone who doesn't want to use them as target practice or the main course at a monster buffet.",
								"In other cases, the sense of isolation may be reinforced by a physical barrier which impedes not only any chance of rescue, but any chance of a quick escape. Examples of physical isolation techniques might include a cave-in which seals off the route which lead the party to this point or a series of iron gates which have slammed shut behind them.",
								"When we are dealing with physical isolation and the means by which the dungeon master inflicts it upon his players, it is important to avoid obvious plot devices and wild coincidences. For example, having a cavern collapse behind the party without reason simply to trap them in the dungeon is generally a bad move. In addition to being an obviously engineered plot device, it detracts from the suspension of disbelief which is vital to any game.",
								"Of course, this doesn't mean that you can never use such a device in your plots, simply keep in mind that you are planning to use one and then justify it ahead of time. If the party is constantly reminded of the creaking timbers holding up the dungeon ceiling and are pelted with minor rockfalls from time to time, then a big cave-in behind them will seem more like a stroke of good fortune (\"At least it didn't fall on us!\") than a plot device.",
								"Another means of inducing physical isolation, that of an intentional barrier which is obviously sprung on the players like a trap, has its own unique advantages. By the same token, it has its drawbacks in the dungeon and must be used with care.",
								"If an iron portcullis comes crashing down behind the party, it must be there for a reason. In all probability, such a trap is set up ahead of time by a band of raiders (goblins, kobolds, or whatever) who plan to ambush passers by as soon as it falls. While the characters have their attention turned to the gate which has just slammed loudly into place, they are attacked by the raiders. Simple enough.",
								"In other cases, the gate (or whatever isolation mechanism is being employed) will be unleashed by someone with more in mind than simply robbing the party. As soon as the party enters the sewers underneath the Tower of the Mad Wizard he might drop iron gates and wizard lock all the exits to keep them from leaving so that he can play cat and mouse with them. In cases like this, the characters should be made aware that not only are they now isolated from the outside world, but also that the bad guys know exactly where they are. Try this the next time to you want to watch a party of powerful characters overcome with fear and apprehension."

While this is not totally eliminated in a dungeon setting, it is greatly reduced.",

But let's take a moment to consider how we can use this dreadful darkness to our advantage in brightening up our adventures.",
								"The first thing to consider is simply this; we know it's dark in a dungeon, and that's why characters will have torches or lanterns with them. A very wise thing to do, of course, but there are inherent problems with torches, lanterns, and other forms of light. The most obvious of these is the fact that light in a dungeon draws attention the way it draws moths in the wilderness. There is no better way to advertise your presence to the inhabitants of a subterranean realm than by casting bright light about for all to see. And make no mistake, while the light may only provide you with good vision for a few yards, it can be seen at much greater distances. To a great many monsters, a light in the distance is like a beacon that says \"free food - all you can eat - come and get it\". A good way to remind characters of just how dark it really is in a dungeon is to extinguish their lights every so often. This can be done with a cloud of steam from a geothermal hot spring or a gust of wind racing along the corridor from some mysterious region up ahead. As often as not, in fact, it can be accomplished with a simple darkness spell cast by some magic using monster."

								"Many underground chambers, especially those created by water, like sea caves or limestone caverns, often have standing water in them. In some cases, it may be only a trickle or a stream while in others it may be a raging river. In addition, the level of water in a cave can change with the passing of time. Sea caves, for example, may be regularly flooded by the rising tide while the river running through a limestone cavern may overflow its banks every spring with the thawing of a near by glacier. Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of dungeon flooding is simply the fact that there is no way to escape the water. In such a confined space, every alcove and hiding place will be filled by the rising tides. Characters unfortunate enough to be caught in such a hazardous situation may find themselves fighting for their lives against the merciless elements."

								"In order for the lack of oxygen in an area to become life threatening, this connection with the surface world must be severed. This can be done with a cave-in or similar physical barrier which actually blocks off the air supply. If this does not fit in well with the plot of the game, the referee may wish to introduce a raging fire or magical spell to deplete the oxygen in an area. In fact, it may not even be necessary to use such drastic means to place the characters in a low oxygen environment. If an area is poorly ventilated, the rapid exertion of a combat with some monster may force their bodies to attempt to metabolize more oxygen than is available."

Of course, the most common means of detecting odorless toxic gases is with the aid of a small songbird in a cage.

These rooms are ornate temples in their own right, having many valuable items used in the practice of their religious beliefs.",

If the gods frown on the actions of a people, they may withhold the rain or send deadly storms to destroy them. In either case, the end result is often the utter destruction of a people. In order to keep the gods of the sky happy, the primitives built this shrine. Its walls were covered with engravings of clouds, storms, and so on."

												"{@b Priest's Chambers:}These living quarters may have been quite spartan or lavishly decorated, depending on the beliefs and practices of the faithful. A secret door in the outer wall provided a means of covert access to the outside world from these rooms.",
												"{@b Vault:} Some items, like silver holy symbols or perhaps even blessed and magical objects, were too important to be stored in the main area off the main hall. For them, this room was built. It has a door with a very advanced lock, thick walls, and may even have been sealed with some form of magic.",
												"{@b Lounge:} This room was decorated with style and taste. It is here that the priests ate their meals and entertained guests. Informal business was often conducted here, as was light entertainment.",
												"{@b Meeting Room:} More formal than the lounge, this chamber was used for business meetings and official transactions.",
												"{@b Lesser Temple:} This temple, while much less impressive than the main dome, is still a wonder to behold.",
												"{@b Kitchen:} A large stove and an assortment of cooking supplies dominated this room.",
												"{@b Pantry:} A variety of pots, jars, and kegs held the temple's foodstuffs here until needed. A trapdoor in the floor leads down to a small, but well stocked wine cellar. It may well be that the passing of the years has turned some of the bottles in this area into priceless collector's vintages."

										"High in the mountains there rests a gentle valley. All in all, it is a peaceful place. At its heart is a broad river, formed by a number of lesser streams which trickle down from the snow covered caps above the valley. As with all rivers, this one naturally began to flow toward the equator and sea level.",
										"It was thwarted in its journey, however, by the towering walls of the mountains which ringed the valley. As the years passed, however, the river slowly carved its way through the mountain. After centuries of effort, it broke through the other side and plunged over a grand precipice into the foothills beyond the mountain range. In its wake, however, it left a network of twisting and treacherous tunnels for adventurers to contend with."

												"{@b Entrance:} This chamber is notable for its high, arched ceiling and the numerous stalactites which dangle from it. The walls have all been worn smooth through ages of natural erosion by the river. A thin band of shore (about 1 yard wide) runs along each side of the water, making walking possible, but very difficult. The water runs very quickly through this region, but can still be navigated by a raft or boat.",
												"{@b Upper Lake:} A secondary stream curves around from the main river to form a large lake in this room. The ceiling is a high, domed affair with a number of stalactites visible on it. A wide shore surrounds the lake which has a slight whirlpool visible in its currents. The whirlpool is not so swift as to be hazardous to boats, but swimmers may be at risk.",
												"{@b Lower Lake:} A slender cascade of water pours from a series of fissures in the ceiling of this cavern to form a broad lake. A number of natural stone pillars provide support for this chamber and the walls glisten with mineral deposits. A fast moving stream flows into the lake through a fairly wide passage while a second stream flows away from the pool down a fairly wide tunnel.",
												"{@b Grotto:} This is a region where the cavern around a length of stream has been widened by natural erosion to form a large chamber. Stalagmites and stalactites are common and the entire area glistens and sparkles with mineral deposits.",
												"{@b Upper Cascade:} At this point, the river enters the top level of long atrium and plunges over a sheer cliff. The roaring of the cascade is intense, and the natural acoustics of the cavern carry the vibrations throughout the area. The river turns into dangerous rapids before it topples over the cliffs and into the darkness below. There is a great deal of shore area atop the waterfall and enough space in the cavern that it might be possible to climb down beside the waterfall, although this is certainly risky.",
												"{@b Dead Pool:} A slow moving stream feeds this pond which has little, if any, current in it. Because of the natural environment of the cave, however, the water has not become stagnant as it would in a swamp. Thus, although it is unmoving, it has remained fairly fresh.",
												"{@b Balcony:} The atrium around the cascade widens at this point, producing a natural balcony around the waterfall. Explorers might reach this region by climbing to it from below or above. It is possible to climb down or up from this area, but the presence of the cascade makes it dangerous to do so.",
												"{@b Upper Pool:} This region is much like the upper lake, but the waterway which feeds it is much less intense. A small pool has formed here which empties through a split in the rock underneath it. A minor whirlpool swirls these waters, but it is dangerous only to swimmers.",
												"{@b Lower Pool:} The water which falls from the upper pool pours into this room through a split in the ceiling. In addition, a slow moving stream enters on one side of the pool and exits on the other. A minor creek, almost a trickle, flows away to form two large dead pools.",
												"{@b Great Pool:} Although a minor stream flows into this chamber, carrying a fair amount of water to the great pool, the majority of it comes from the grand cascade. Pouring down through a wide chimney which stretches out of sight overhead is a gigantic waterfall. It thunders down from high above to form this great body of water. The entire chamber vibrates with its intensity. The water roars out two exits to plunge over a sheer cliff face and vanish into the mists of the valley below."

										"Long ago, the inhabitants of a rich area of fertile plains discovered the secrets of agriculture. Their land furnished them with everything they needed to survive and be comfortable. Others, jealous of their high standard of living, began to raid the peaceful farmers. Unlike other regions, where stone for building was common, these people did not even have tall trees to fashion into walls. Instead, they set about building a new type of city.",
										"For walls, they used dried mud or adobe. While not as hard as stone, it would hold up well enough against the light weapons of their enemies. As their city grew, they built each house right up against the building beside it. No doors or windows faced outward to offer easy access to intruders. The doors to the buildings were placed above, on the roofs, with ladders and stairs providing access to them. In the end, they had a small community which was not only solid and hard to attack, but also very comfortable to live in."

										"Over the years, the climate changed. The gentle rains which had brought life to their prairie fields ceased to fall and the streams which ran through their farms dried up. In the end, they were forced to assemble their belongings and move on. No record remains of what became of them, but the beehive city speaks a silent testimony to their resourceful natures and their will to survive.",
										"As the grasslands continued to dry, they gradually became deserts. Finally, this vast sea of sand swallowed up the beehive city in a dark sandstorm which raged for days across the once fertile lands. The city, like its people, vanished without a trace."

												"{@b Family Chambers:} This portion of the city housed the farmers and their loved ones. Each chamber was home to an extended family, ranging in size from 7 to 12 persons. Raised platforms around the perimeter served as both beds and sofas. In many cultures, the dead were buried beneath the floor of the chamber they had once lived in.",
												"{@b Barracks:} Single men and members of the guard lived in these chambers which were very much like the military barracks one might expect to find in a modern fort. There was little provision for comfort, and almost no chance for individual privacy.",
												"{@b Temples:} The people of the beehive city were faithful to their gods. As proof of this, they scattered a number of temples and altars throughout the complex. Each of these was richly decorated (in comparison to the rest of the city) and served as a cultural nexus for the people living here.",
												"{@b Governor's Home:} This living area served the ruler of the city and his family. It was well equipped and decorated, a tribute to the status accorded the popular leader of these people.",
												"{@b Officers' Barracks:} Although much more spacious and better appointed than the barracks assigned to the rest of the soldiers, these quarters are very spartan and focus on utility more than comfort.",
												"{@b Granaries:} As various crops became ready for harvest they were stored in the city's many granaries. Of course, the passing of time may have utterly destroyed these foodstuffs, but some evidence of their passing may well remain.",
												"{@b Kiln:} A look around at the various chambers on the map of the beehive city will make it obvious to the reader that those who lived here made great use of pottery. This kiln, which was fired with a variety of organic material, was somewhat primitive, but still very functional. There may be remnants of pottery items here when the area is explored.",
												"{@b Courtyards:} In the event of a siege or raid on the city, an assortment of livestock could be transferred to these protected areas to provision the inhabitants for a time. When the city was not under attack, they served as parks or play areas for children and adults alike."

Eventually, the fierce stone fortress was swallowed up by the water and mud. When the region dried up years later, the castle was nothing more than a large mound of dried mud. Underneath this shell, however, is the catacomb that had once been the Castle on the Moors."

Kegs of ale, bottles of wine, wheels of cheese, and many other supplies were kept here, although the passing of the years has almost certainly ruined them.",

It was here that the lord of the manor held his parties and entertained his guests. Great feasts could be sent up from the kitchen below and performers could entertain the guests while they relaxed and ate.",

												"{@b Day Room:} This room was well appointed and provided the lord and his family with a pleasant place for light entertaining and socializing. It's furnishings were both comfortable and functional.",
												"{@b Knights' Chambers:} Each of these rooms served as the living quarters for one of the lord's most faithful warriors. If they were married, then their wives shared their rooms with them. If not, they had a live-in squire who tended to their needs and hoped to learn something of the warrior's trade from his master.",
												"{@b Workrooms:} Although these rooms were used by the castle staff for spinning, weaving, and other light work, they were more than just areas for light industry. At the close of each day, the looms and such were put away and bedrolls covered the floor. While these seeping accommodations for the castle staff were far from luxurious, they were better than those available to most of the local peasants.",
												"{@b Towers:} Each corner of the Castle on the Moors was anchored to a strong stone tower. From the tops of these battlements, archers could fire volley after volley of lethal arrows onto attacking armies. In addition, each of the towers had its own catapult for hurling large projectiles at invaders."
