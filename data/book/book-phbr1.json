That's a standard in the armorer's industry; they'll always tell you it takes ten weeks to work up a chain mail hauberk. But in an emergency situation, they could put an extra apprentice on the job (either have two working on it at once, or have one on the \"day shift\" and one on the \"night shift\"). With twice the available manpower, it would only take half the time, or five weeks, to create the chain mail.}"

This is usually the case with armorers when they first go into business for themselves: They pay the cost for materials and the cost for their apprentices, and whatever they have left over is their own salary, even if it is much less than the 15 gp/week standard mentioned above. (That number, 15 gp/week, represents a firm lower-middle-class standard of living; an armorer who earns less will be living at a lower-class standard of living.)",

If just the chief armorer, who counts as an Overseer if his Armorer ability check is 12 or better, works on this item alone, it will take him only two weeks to make the hide armor (remember, an Overseer counts as two apprentices; therefore, he's putting four times the manpower on the task as it customarily requires, thus cutting the time required to one-fourth, or two weeks). If he can sell it for 15 gp, he's made 8 gp. He's earning a meager 4 gp a week, which is better than a poverty-level wage, but less than middle-class."

This type of flawed armor functions at 1 AC higher than it should (thus flawed full plate would be AC 2 instead of 1). If the flawed armor is ever struck in real combat with a natural to-hit roll of 19 or 20, it \"breaks\" (caves in, splits open, etc.). Its AC goes up 4 (thus our flawed full plate would shoot from AC 2 to AC 6). And because it's broken and hanging wrong, it hinders the player; until he can take it off (this takes 1d4 rounds), he moves at half his normal rate and suffers a −4 penalty to all of his attack rolls.",

Sometimes a bonus proficiency will come from a group other than the General or Warrior groups, but, since it's a bonus, it doesn't matter how many extra slots it would otherwise be required to occupy.",
                        "Some proficiencies will merely be recommended, not required. When a choice is recommended, it is not given to the character; if the character decides to take this nonweapon proficiency, he takes it from the number of choices he has.",

                        "{@b Equipment:} Some Warrior Kits gravitate toward certain types of equipment. Noble Warriors tend toward heavy armor and weapons such as swords and lances; Pirates lean toward cutlasses, throwing knives, light or no armor, and the like.",
                        "These equipment listings aren't really restrictions or hard-and-fast rules. A Pirate on shore may wish to deck himself out in full plate, for instance. But in normal circumstances, a character should gravitate toward the types of equipment appropriate for him, and the DM must steer him toward such equipment types.",
                        "For example, the pirate who keeps his full plate on while aboard ship will be knocked overboard time and time again as a reminder of why pirates don't usually wear such cumbersome stuff. As he's being dragged to the ocean bottom, he can reflect on his mistake. A noble warrior who wears leathers when jousting will almost certainly get what {@i he} deserves for his folly.",
                        "{@b Special Benefits:} Most Warrior Kits have some special benefits that others don't. Often, they're defined as special reaction bonuses among certain classes of society, special rights in certain cultures, and so forth. Other benefits are more unusual or dramatic: The Berserker can call on hidden resources of strength and vitality when in combat, for instances.",
                        "{@b Special Hindrances:} Likewise, each Warrior Kit has certain disadvantages which hinder him. Pirates are sought by the authorities; Amazons face discrimination in male-dominated societies.",
                        "{@b Wealth Options:} Some Warrior Kits have special rules regarding their wealth. The Noble Warrior, for instance, will begin play with more starting gold than some other Warrior Kits. However, he's also required to maintain a higher standard of living than the others. If he fails to do so, he temporarily loses some of his Special Benefits.",
                        "{@b Races:} Each of these Kits is written with the human character in mind, and this paragraph describes what happens when you have a demihuman character instead. The DM will have to ask himself if he wants certain race/Warrior Kit combinations (Savage Elves? Dwarf Amazons? Noble Halfling-Warriors?). If he does allow them, this paragraph will make notes on recommended racial modifications. For instance, the Noble Dwarf-Warrior will be required to be proficient with axe and hammer rather than sword and lance, and won't be required to be a rider.",

He's the responsible hero who, even if he isn't party leader, thinks like one: He's always thinking about the team's goals and how to implement them, the safety of his friends, the strategy of the bad guys, and so forth. He may be happy to be the leader-type, or may be a reluctant leader; either way, his friends look to him for direction. Naturally, you should only choose this personality type for your character if you're to make the effort to do all that thinking and planning, and are willing for your character to be responsible for others.",

However, if you have a good rationale for a Chaotic Natural Leader, your DM may choose to allow you to play it that way. Most Warrior Kits are appropriate to this personality type, especially the Cavalier and Noble Warrior. In a party representing several different Warrior Kits, though, the Berserker and Savage shouldn't be Natural Leaders: Other character types don't tend to trust them as leaders.",

He makes sure that there's a good mix of ranged to melee combat, that shield walls don't have big holes in them, that when a friend falls there's someone to drag him behind the lines and another to take his place. If a player with a Natural Leader character doesn't do this, and simply jumps right into combat without any intent to think about or direct things, the DM should assign him temporary minuses to attack rolls and damage: This reflects the fact that the {@i character} is troubled by his failure to lead, even if the {@i player} isn't.",
                                "{@b In Role-Playing Situations:} The Natural Leader is a very responsible character, but beyond that, there is no limitation on the way he should be played in role-playing situations. He may be grim or humorous, straightforward or deceitful, arrogant or modest, as the player decides. He will often be the negotiator for the party, but this isn't required of him."

It's up to the player whether the character is actually cowardly or not: Sneaky Thinkers can be as brave as the bravest warrior in a pinch, if that's the player's conception of the character.",

It's very hard to find out what the Sneaky Thinker is actually thinking or feeling. Note that it's a dangerous temptation to trick your friends and allies; in a campaign where the PCs' party is founded on trust and allegiance, such a Sneaky Thinker will probably find himself cast out or killed for betraying his erstwhile friends."

                                "The most interesting purpose for such a campaign would be to showcase a clash of cultures: Have a party of Amazon player-characters go adventuring in the outside world (the mysterious, dangerous, treacherous, woefully male-dominated outside world). A lot of the role-playing opportunity provided by such a campaign would involve the characters doing the following: Running up against, and battering down, prejudices against women warriors; and fighting their own prejudices, which dictate either that men are inferior and must be downtrodden, or are all treacherous and must always be viewed with distrust and suspicion. They can also have encouraging, amusing or even tragic encounters with the women of the outside world, whom they try to convince that the Amazon way of life is the One True Way.",
                                "Here's a sample adventure idea, drawn from mythlore about the Amazons:",
                                "Before the adventure begins, a ship from the world of men (or a group of horsemen, if your Amazons are landbound) arrives in the Amazon community, claiming to wish to conduct peaceful trade or negotiations with the Amazon peoples. They are graciously received by the Amazon court and negotiations are held.",
                                "But something goes wrong. The next morning the negotiators are gone, all fled—and the Queen is missing, too, obviously kidnapped by the men. The queen's sister assembles and sends forth a team of crack warriors, the player-characters, to retrieve the kidnapped queen or die trying.",
                                "The PCs must equip themselves, then head into the outer world. In the course of their pursuit of the kidnappers, they'll meet a lot of NPCs. Some will be callous and stupid, intending only to oppress or enslave the PCs, and must be dealt with by cunning or violence. Others will be admiring of the characters' independence and ability, and will challenge the Amazon notion that all men in the outer world are their enemies.",
                                "Finally, when the PCs reach the city where their queen is being held, the DM has to decide what her true status is. She might have indeed been kidnapped by the negotiators and needs to be rescued; the Amazon PCs may need to break into her prison and sneak her out, or may need to ally themselves with an outer-world army and sack the city. Or, she might not have been kidnapped at all, but might instead have been struck by a sudden love for one of the negotiators, and fled with him—especially fleeing her responsibilities as queen. If that's the case, the PCs might choose to turn around and go home, or might have to sack the city anyway, to avenge the affront done them by their thoughtless ex-queen.",
                                "Since not many playing groups will want to switch over to the eccentric all-Amazon format, you ought to read the text below on \"Campaign vs. Mini-Series\" for a way to play such a thing without disrupting your usual campaign."

First, it's an opportunity for a campaign with a {@i lot} of combat, especially if the campaign revolves around clashes between two or more competing tribes.

They repel invasions, hunt mighty and monstrous animals for their meat, attack rival tribes, and do whatever they can to ensure their own tribe's survival. Here's one sample adventure idea: In wastelands distant from civilization, two tribes do battle. One is an NPC tribe, and the other is represented by the player-characters and some NPCs. The two tribes can be enemies because they compete for hunting lands, because of some old grudge, for any reason or none.",

The tribes may continue their running battle through the city, awakening the ancient, sleeping monsters, who will eventually come after the barbarians, forcing them to combine their efforts or die...",
                                "Another type is the Barbarians in a {@i Civilized World Campaign}: The player-character barbarians and berserkers travel through the so-called civilized world. They may be seeking a new place to settle their tribe, the old site being untenable for one reason or another; they may be mercenaries who hire themselves out to anyone with enough gold; they may be pursuing some villain who insulted them, or who sacked their village while the warriors were away adventuring.",
                                "The player-characters travel through a world where civilization equals decadence, where all men are weaker than our barbarian heroes. They encounter terrifying black magic in jungle ruins, battle enemy armies which stand in their way, stumble across hidden evil wizards and the bizarre monsters they create, and so forth.",
                                "Yet another type is the {@i Barbarians for the Crown Campaign}: This is much like the Barbarians in a Civilized World campaign, but here the barbarian heroes have a purpose. One or more of them intends to rule a civilized nation. He and his friends must gather enough power to be able to accomplish this, usually by joining the army of some great nation, rising quickly through its ranks (all the while going on many dangerous army-oriented adventures), and winning enough popular support in the army and elsewhere that they can overthrow the current despotic royal family.",
                                "A last choice for a campaign combines all three of the campaign styles above. In the early stages of the campaign, all the characters are great tribal defenders; many adventures can be run with this theme. Later, some great calamity forces the heroes to leave their native tribe. As described earlier, this could be a mission of vengeance which forces them to leave for the outer world; it could be the destruction of their entire tribe by powerful, evil forces; it could be a prophecy which says that one of the PCs will bring doom on the tribe if he stays, but glory to himself and his companions if he leaves. So for many game-years the heroes will adventure in the outer world, until something (another prophecy, their own desires, the desires or manipulations of an NPC involved with the group) point them at the crumbling throne of a great nation.",
                                "In the Barbarians and Berserkers campaign, by the way, magic use is almost always scorned. Magic is considered unclean and almost all wizards are evil enemies of the heroes. Though it would not be inappropriate for one character to be some sort of shamanistic hero (for example, a dual-class Fighter/Mage), this sort of campaign is best suited to worlds with little or no magic."

Now, he's sending his own warriors after the tribe's animals, trying to destroy them and conquer the tribe. If the player-character tribesmen ride dire wolves, the sorcerer's minions, fewer in number than the tribesmen, will be ogres riding smilodons (sabre-tooth tigers).

In their early adventures, these Cavaliers are gaining experience, rising up from the lowest levels, and assembling clues as to what sort of menace the world faces. As they learn more, and begin to have more and more direct confrontations with the minions of the menace, they realize that the threat is indeed real...and that they're not yet adequate to save the day.

Treasure-hunting trips into eerie valleys (populated by lost tribes, monsters out of ancient legend, or dangerous and alien wizards), and elaborate raiding missions against the encroachments of civilization, are two good examples. Also, the Jungle King seems always to fall in love with a woman from the outer-world civilization, and she, in turn, has a tendency to be kidnapped out of her new jungle haven; other adventures can involve missions to rescue her.

As you spot them, they spot you, too, and slow down. You can't tell what they are...\" At this point, if the PCs have missile weapons and the NPCs don't, the PCs can take this free shot, but are faced with the prospect of attacking an unknown quantity.

In such a case, the PC is usually responsible for teaching the page or squire to fight ({@i without} getting him killed) so that NPC might someday become a knight."

Oriental armor is colorful and elaborately constructed, often brightly enamelled or decorated with paint or painted leathers, silk cords, precious-metal plating, etc.",
                                "But from a game-mechanic point of view, leather armor is leather armor, plate is plate. Samurai wear armor that is the equivalent of padded leather, studded leather, scale mail, and brigandine; basic costs, weights, and AC values are identical to the western armor styles. However, a samurai may wish to spend more than the minimum amount on his armor; the extra money goes into making it a remarkable example of eastern art.",

The bracelet itself can be used only eight times in a day; turning the bracelet into a weapon counts as one use, and turning the weapon back into a bracelet counts as one use.",

With a single warrior, the weapons carried might be a long bow and quiver (quivers count as part of the weapon they carry arrows for), a bastard sword, a halberd, and a dagger. This gives the warrior the ability to call forth the weapon best suited to the task at hand.",

This tent confers no magical blessing on its inhabitants, but by using it and huddling together for warmth a party can survive a snowstorm that would kill an unprotected party; by erecting it in the desert, a party can avoid the danger and discomfort of a sandstorm.",
                        "If the user claps his hands three times, the cage grows up into a strong 10' by 10' cell. The door to the cell has the equivalent of a {@i {@spell wizard lock}}; the cage's owner can open it any time he wishes, and any magician with the {@i {@spell knock}} spell can open it by using that spell. A person in the cell would have to make his Bend Bars/Lift Gates roll successfully (or use a knock) to escape; the door's lock cannot be picked.",

If someone is in it when it is a tent and begins collapsing, it opens up around the person inside; both he and it are unhurt. If someone is in it when it is a cage and begins collapsing, it collapses around him, inflicting {@dice 2d6} damage before it breaks open; thereafter, it is ruined forever.",

If its true owner sells it to someone else in the cage's presence, the cage will obey the claps of its new owner immediately.",

This is a small charm or statuette, usually of semiprecious material and two or three inches in size, which represents the god or one of his aspects.",
                        "The {@i charm} is rather like a {@i {@spell limited wish}}. It represents a favor which the deity will do for the character at some time in the future. To use it, the owner must throw the item on the ground so hard that it breaks, and then call out his request.",
                        "The request must have something to do with the attributes of the god: It's no use asking the Goddess of Love to dry up an oasis into a desert, or to ask the God of Earthquakes for a fog to hide the adventurers.",
                        "The god hears it when the favor is requested. And he, in the guise of the DM, evaluates the favor. If the favor is something which pertains to one of his attributes, and if the god does not think that the character is making the request out of mere greed or selfishness, and if bestowing the favor will not conflict with any of the god's other aims or desires, he will grant the favor.",
                        "So it would be appropriate to ask the God of Insects to send a cloud of bees to rout one's enemies, or to ask the Goddess of Love to cause some NPC to fall in love with the player-character, or to ask a deity of the Earth to cause fruit-trees to grow and save the characters from death by thirst and starvation.",
                        "Because the deity is evaluating the character's request, the asking character cannot expect an outrageous favor to be granted. And most enemies who steal the charm from the PC cannot use it successfully; one might take it, hurl it to the ground and break it with his request, and find the cranky god stomping on him and freeing the faithful PC. (This, however, constitutes using up the favor.) But an NPC friend of the owner of the {@i charm} might be able to get the item and ask the god to help the charm's true owner...particularly if he is ill or kidnapped and cannot do so for himself.",
                        "Any character of any class can receive such a charm as a favor. But when they are found in treasure, they are useless; they were not intended for the character who finds them, after all.",

                        "When the larger ring is attached to an object, and the smaller ring is worn by a character, the character needs only to utter the magical word inscribed on the inside of the smaller ring. When he does, if the other ring is within 10 miles, it will instantaneously transport that object to the character.",

If the item is a suit of armor, it appears on the character; if he is already wearing a suit of armor, it appears next to him. If the item is something else, it appears in a fashion dictated by the DM; a crown will appear on the character's head, while a sewing machine would appear next to him, for instance.",

                        "But it doesn't hold a knife. It holds a sword—a full-sized sword. With magic rather like that found in the {@i bag of holding}, this item slides most of the length of the blade into a pocket dimension, so that only the weapon's hilt shows, with the sheath suggesting another 5'' or so of blade. (This looks rather strange when it holds a bastard sword, where the hilt will be longer than the apparent blade, but the {@i sheath of holding} can do it.)",
