The rule given in the player's handbook is simple: at the end of a fall, you take {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maximum of {@dice 20d6}. You also land {@condition prone}, unless you somehow avoid taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional rules that expand on that simple rule.",{"type":"entries","name":"Rate of Falling","page":77,"entries":["The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a {@creature griffon} or on board an {@item airship}? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred. If you'd like high-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the following optional rule.","When you fall from a great height, you instantly descend up to 500 feet. If you're still falling on your next turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process continues until the fall ends, either because you hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted."],"source":"XGE"},{"type":"entries","name":"Flying Creatures and Falling","page":77,"entries":["A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked {@condition prone}, if its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the {@spell fly} spell.","If you'd like a flying creature to have a better chance of surviving a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this rule: subtract the creature's current flying speed from the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked {@condition prone} but is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is greater than 0 feet. The rule is designed to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar measures to slow the velocity of its fall.","If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns still falling and is {@condition prone}, it can halt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the {@condition prone} condition (as if it were standing up in midair)."],"source":"XGE"}],"data":{"quickref":3},"source":"XGE"},{"type":"section","name":"Simultaneous Effects","page":77,"entries":["Most effects in the game happen in succession, following an order set by the rules or the DM. In rare cases, effects can happen at the same time, especially at the start or end of a creature's turn. If two or more things happen at the same time on a character or monster's turn, the person at the game table-whether player or DM-who controls that creature decides the order in which those things happen. For example, if two effects occur at the end of a player character's turn, the player decides which of the two effects happens first."],"data":{"quickref":3},"source":"XGE"},{"type":"section","name":"Sleep","page":77,"entries":["Just as in the real world, D&D characters spend many hours sleeping, most often as part of a long rest. Most monsters also need to sleep. While a creature sleeps, it is subjected to the {@condition unconscious} condition. Here are a few rules that expand on that basic fact.",{"type":"entries","name":"Waking Someone","page":77,"entries":["A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise-such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell-also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.","Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher."],"source":"XGE"},{"type":"entries","name":"Sleeping in Armor","page":77,"entries":["Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.","When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of {@condition exhaustion}, the rest doesn't reduce your {@condition exhaustion} level."],"source":"XGE"},{"type":"entries","name":"Going without a Long Rest","page":78,"entries":["A long rest is never mandatory, but going without sleep does have its consequences. If you want to account for the effects of sleep deprivation on characters and creatures, use these rules.","Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a {@dc 10} Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion}.","It becomes harder to fight off {@condition exhaustion} if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest."],"source":"XGE"}],"data":{"quickref":3},"source":"XGE"},{"type":"section","name":"Tying Knots","page":78,"entries":["The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one. Here's an optional rule for determining the effectiveness of a knot.","The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check.","This rule intentionally links {@skill Sleight of Hand} with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule in the {@variantrule Skills with Different Abilities|phb|\"Variant: Skills with Different Abilities\"} section in chapter 7 of the player's handbook."],"data":{"quickref":3},"source":"XGE"}]}]}}
